this is what I was aiming for. We don't (really) know if the input is a
non-WAAS handheld or a RTK enabled DGPS. RTK can give to ~2mm horiz and
(same as other GPSs) an order of magnitude worse in the vertical.

Plus I'd guess &quot;1mm is enough for anyone&quot;. (good enough for engineering
apps) Plus here in NZ one half of the country is moving ~45mm/year in
the opposite direction as the other side of the country, so readings
quickly go out of date ;).

this sucks. I remember many moons ago in the SA days being frustrated by
GPS firmware which would only output Minutes as %02.3 instead of %02.4,
even when we had DGPS going into it, needlessly throwing away positional
accuracy.

&gt;<i>   have the protocol dynamically change resolution based on EPE.  This
</I>&gt;<i>   seems too complicated and unnecessary.
</I>
agreed, ugly.

&gt;<i> Of these, only the first seems reasonable.  Imagine if NTP used ASN.1
</I>&gt;<i> to have a variable number of bits after the radix point, instead of
</I>&gt;<i> always way too many :-)
