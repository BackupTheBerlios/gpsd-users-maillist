<PRE>Over the weekend I installed 2.3.4 under Fedora Core 6 x86_64 and ran
it with a Motorola Oncore GT connected via an (out-of-production)
interface board from a gent named Larry Cochrane.    The interface
board has an output for 1PPS and I routed this to pin 1 (DCD) on the
DB9 RS232 output (which did not otherwise seem to be connected.

I ran gpsd at debug level 5 and initially seemed to run fine.  For the
period before the GPS got a fix, I saw frequest messages to the effect
that 1PPS status was changing. Good.  Once it got a fix, the 1PPS
messages stopped appearing.

After some period of time, though, gpsd would segfault after a number
of messages to the effect &quot;too many satellites&quot;  Ironic, I am using
this GPS for timing, mostly, and, as it has a view only to the east, I
was hard pressed to get enough satellites to get a 2D fix.

Anyhow, I removed the 2.3.4 RPM and rebuilt from source with same
result.  I also edited drivers.c and increased satellites under NMEA
to 14, but no change.

I see reference to this &quot;too many satellites&quot; being fixed previously.
Any thoughts on steps I should take/  Any additional logging I could
capture that would be more informative?

FWIW, in the meantime I have the Oncore running and configured NTP to
use it directly as an NMEA (non-1PPS) device.  No problem.  I have not
tried running it as 1PPS Oncore as I didn't want to do that extra work
if I can get gpsd to work.

Thanks,

Jim
