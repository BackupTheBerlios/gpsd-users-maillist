   I do tend to agree with Chris that tacking more data at the end of
the PVT report somehow does not seem a particularly attractive idea.

   One way to approach this would be to define what a PVT report should
be.  I propose that it should be a message giving you the geographical
position (lat., lon., height) of the GPS antenna, its velocity (as a
cartesian or polar vector), and time (UTC), along with the relevant
precision figures for all of these (DOPs, RMS, TFOM, ...)

   As it happens, the above is exactly what the O message gives now.
Thus, adding extra sensor data to it would no longer make it a strict
PVT report.

   OTOH, the new protocol could supply a mechanism for clients to define
exactly which data they want in a report (be it one-off or streamed),
and we could go from there.  A client could say, for example:

EXAMPLE=timestamp latitude longitude height course speed depth
water_temp hrms vrms course_err speed_err depth_err water_temp_err

to define a message named &quot;EXAMPLE&quot; which would return the requested
bits of information (along with their error estimates).  Some mechanism
could then be provided to specify when and how this information should
be returned, e.g., one could say:

EXAMPLE:onchange
EXAMPLE:1Hz
EXAMPLE

to send the message when the information changes, every one second, or
just once, respectively.

   A number of pre-programmed messages could be defined so as to
simplify client-side programming.

   And also, perhaps a mechanism would be needed to inform clients of
what information is there available at a particular time, which would
depend on the capabilities of whichever instrument(s) is/are attached to
gpsd at that time.

   I am sure there is some obvious fundamental flaw in the approach I've
just described, but you chaps are in a better position than me to tell
what the disadvantages are. I'll leave you to it for now.

Regards,
Diego Berge.
