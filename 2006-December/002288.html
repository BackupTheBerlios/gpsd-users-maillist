<PRE>I've been thudding at this email for a few days now.... in the
meantime, those of you following gpsd-commit-watch might have noticed
that we've started taking some of these suggestions to heart. I
suspect we'll be continuing to revise as we get more comments and use
cases.

On 11/30/06, Eric S. Raymond &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-users">esr at thyrsus.com</A>&gt; wrote:
&gt;<i> It makes pretty pictures.  And stimulates a couple of thoughts in my mind...
</I>
More than one geek I know calls graphs &quot;manager porn&quot;; sometimes a
graph is not merely pretty to look at but it is absolutely the right
way to condense stuff. This toy was actually a side effect of setting
up my ANTARIS so I could debug OpenBSD's time stamping code. I wanted
to know what my actual sky view was.

As a side effect, it's instructive on a couple of fronts. It helps you
understand polar plots (if you didn't already get it) and it's a very
clear demonstration of multi-path. At least at gpsd2, everything
that's not green is a reflection around here, is probably 20 or 30
metres of path error.

&gt;<i> One:  As a fit-and-finish issue, I'm beginning to think we need a common set
</I>&gt;<i> of default visual conventions for our sky-views.  That is, somebody who has
</I>&gt;<i> seen xgps should be able to interpret output from these PHP scripts at
</I>&gt;<i> a glance and vice-versa.  When the GNOME client comes in, its defaults
</I>
GTK, not GNOME. or the Qt client. Or wxWidgets.

&gt;<i> should look the same way.
</I>
Indeed. I know for sure I've failed in my presentation style if I have
to go back to the source to see what the picture means. thus far:
* not-completely-sucky. it makes sense to me.
* a small success: others look at it and say &quot;oooh, shiny!&quot;
* possibly a good idea, even: others look at it and decide to use it...

&gt;<i> In each case, there could be other presentations -- I don't want to
</I>&gt;<i> step on anyone's creativity or prevent experiments that might lead us
</I>&gt;<i> to a better set of conventions -- but the *defaults* should look
</I>&gt;<i> the same.
</I>
I'd like to see what other tools gpsd users have come up with.

&gt;<i> I mostly like Chris's conventions -- actually, I like them better than
</I>&gt;<i> my own attempts to pack more information into the xgps skyview.  As a
</I>&gt;<i> start, I suppose I should fix xgps.c to use them.  One change I would
</I>&gt;<i> like to see is WAAS/EGNOS satellites rendered in a different shape; a
</I>&gt;<i> little diamond or square would be my first choice.  Right now we're
</I>&gt;<i> using color to convey two different kinds of information -- signal
</I>&gt;<i> strength and satellite type -- which is just generally bad practice in a
</I>&gt;<i> UI like this.
</I>
No objection to a different shape. I guess I could abstract gd's
ImageFilledPolygon() into something a little prettier. I was just
being lazy... because plotting a circle was easy and plotting polygons
meant I had to compute vertexes.

&gt;<i> Two: I think this script crosses a line I had hoped nobody would push
</I>&gt;<i> for a while.  Maintenance problems rise with the square of the number
</I>&gt;<i> of languages in the package, and I was serious about trying to hold us
</I>&gt;<i> to C and Python.  I took Chris's gpsd.php script because it's fairly
</I>&gt;<i> hard to argue with PHP for live web pages, but I was a little uneasy
</I>&gt;<i> about it because I feared opening the floodgates to anyone's favorite
</I>&gt;<i> special-purpose language.
</I>
I only used php for sky view because I had 99% of what I needed
already done; you can totally see where I ripped off gpsd.php. I have
a perl script in my cvs tree that does something very similar, but its
output isn't nearly as pretty.

Note that I never pushed for the integration of gpsd.php or
regress-build or this sky view analyzer. This is more along the lines
of &quot;here's a tool that I use with gpsd. It's not core to gpsd's main
mission, but it's compatible with the program. Enjoy!&quot;

&gt;<i> So, what happens next?  Chris, the clever bastard, materializes some
</I>&gt;<i> code that is a near-perfect argument for accepting PHP as a main
</I>&gt;<i> language for the data-analysis tools.  I look at it, and while the right
</I>&gt;<i> hemisphere of my brain goes &quot;Oooh, *shiny*...&quot; the left hemisphere
</I>&gt;<i> is screaming &quot;Nooooo!  No more languages!&quot;
</I>
If you don't like php, I could redo it in perl. I prefer perl over
php, but php has better integration into my web servers.

This is a great argument for / example of reusable code; it took maybe
3 minutes to write skyview.php, because so much of what i needed was
already there.

&gt;<i> We've got more than you'd think.   To be a competent maintainer for
</I>&gt;<i> the entire project one should need to be able to at least limp along
</I>&gt;<i> in all of C, C++, Python, shell, PHP, and gnuplot.
</I>
Don't forget rudimentary make and m4 (if you dare to hack at the
autoconf stuff).

After you get a grip on the syntax of the languages, you get to learn
tool kits and their bindings: gd, gtk, motif, qt, wxwidgets .... :P

GD is wonderful for programmatically generating pictures. Scripting
languages are wonderful for slurping up text and drawing a graph. I
could have written a pure C/gd tool do the same thing, but I'm lazy.
It's way easier to do this this kind of processing in a scripting
language; chances are, you're going to be tinkering with the guts of
it quite frequently, and this just feels like a scripting language
kind of task.

&gt;<i> So, even though half my brain is still going &quot;Oooh, shiny!&quot; I think
</I>&gt;<i> I have to say nyet, this at most goes into the contrib directory as
</I>&gt;<i> unsupported.
</I>
there's a reason why i didn't commit it, why i called it fluffy... I
wouldn't mind seeing something like this go into contrib, where it can
live with sundry other analyzers. I'm actually quite surprised that
I've received any feedback on it at all, but I've had several
indications that there is a demand for this sort of thing.

&gt;<i> As a to-do item, we might add translating this into
</I>&gt;<i> Python that generates gnuplot, the way gpsprof does.
</I>
Pain. And. Agony. I'm not fond of gnuplot's command language, nor its
inconsistencies in output devices. Nor some of its obstinant
molly-coddling behaviour.

-- 
GDB has a 'break' feature; why doesn't it have 'fix' too?
