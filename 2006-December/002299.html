</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'm in favor of passing everything -
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; because maybe, just maybe, today we are using an RTK or dual-frequency

Fun!

And yes,  &quot;maybe&quot;. The daemon generally has no a priori knowledge of
what receiver it is going to be communicating with. Sometimes it can
probe the receiver, sometimes it can't.

&gt;<i> &gt; And any serious analysis program is going to check the quality flags
</I>&gt;<i> anyway.
</I>&gt;<i> And the RMS values.
</I>
ie. We hope no one Seriously using GPS is just going to believe the
position reports without somehow checking their quality.

&gt;<i> Sorry, what is DR? (too tired to look at the code now).
</I>
Dead Reckoning. Automotive-integrated sets (for example) may take
odometer ticks off the drivetrain, and gyro/accelerometer outputs from
the ABS and mash those into the navigation solution when the GPS
signal is degraded/unavailable.

My laptop (Thinkpad T42) has accelerometers onboard. I did up a kernel
patch to make them output at 100Hz and calibrated the output, so I
have some fairly entertaining logs from my last time out at the
racetrack. I was foolish and didn't put my SiRF into binary mode
before I started logging, so I really only have graphs of fairly well
correlated position, speed, acceleration and time, but not closely
linked enough to postprocess... at least, i don't think they're good
enough.

&gt;<i> Off the top of my head, I can't think of anything else other than the
</I>&gt;<i> quality indicators already present (DGPS status, RMS, DOPs), except perhaps
</I>&gt;<i> that you would want to include some extra output such as vectors to the base
</I>&gt;<i> station and status info. But as I said, I would have to have a think about
</I>&gt;<i> it when I am properly rested.
</I>
Hm. That'll require a different message format. For now, the O message
(7DOF PVT solution with 95% confidence intervals) is what we've got.
It's a good format. We're not dismissing this extra RTK metadata
outright, but I don't think it has a place in the standard PVT report.

Stick around though - you can help us with the Next Generation
Protocol. As an actual user of RTK gear, you can tell us whether or
not a message format contains enough useful information.

&gt;<i> btw, I've just had another stupid idea (RINEX output) but I'd rather not
</I>&gt;<i> mention it until I'm back from leave in two weeks time. :P
</I>
That's hardly stupid. If you read the archives of gpsd-users and
gpsd-dev and you will see that I've been mulling that over for some
time. I've tried to restrict my gps purchases to hardware that does
actually give me carrier phase and pseudorange so I can hack on this
sort of thing.

GDB has a 'break' feature; why doesn't it have 'fix' too?
