<PRE>After due consideration, Chris Kuethe and I have decided to ship 2.34
despite the still somewhat questionable state of the Garmin driver.
Gary Miller is still trying to cope with various personal disasters,
and we don't think we can wait for him to emerge before releasing.
We've told him we want him to take all the time he needs away from the
project in order to straighten out more important things, so we need
to show we can soldier on without him.

This announcement should be considered notification of imminent
release, like within the next 48 hours.  If you have pending bug
reports or anything you think is a release-critical issue, tell us
now.

As an experiment, Chris is going to be the release engineer this time.  
I've written some scripts that will allow him to remote-build 32- and 
64-bit RPMS on two of my machines; these are now in the svn repo and will
be available for future release engineers.  The objective here is both
technical and social engineering -- I want to mechanically routinize 
the release process, and I want to spread the capability and authority
to do releases so my absence won't block the critical path.

Post-release, the code freeze melts.  The two things we're interested
in starting work on immediately are new binary-protocol drivers from
Andreas Stricker and Diego Burge.

More on post-release plans in the next mail...
