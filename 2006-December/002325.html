<PRE>Hi there,

    ...and greetings from Kosovo! :)

   You will notice (from the example I gave above) that it is the
client's responsibility to explicitly request them.  The trickish bit
would be for gpsd to determine which capabilities the attached GPS has,
so it can pass that info on to the client when requested.  I am thinking
of something such as:

 &lt;&lt;&lt; GET DATAFIELDS
 &gt;&gt;&gt; DATAFIELDS=timestamp latitude longitude height altitude
geoid_separation [...etc...] tfom hrms vrms geoid_separation_err [...etc...]

   I am thinking of this as a (hopefully) possible way to allow
different drivers to provide as many odd bits of information as they see
fit without the main code needing to know about it.  Just an idea.  Does
this sound too far fetched in principle?

&gt;<i> But there's a larger problem.  This design doesn't actually solve any
</I>&gt;<i> problem *except* that of satisfying a religious desire to keep &quot;extra&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> information out of PVT reports.
</I>
   Actually, I thought about it as a mechanism for the drivers to
provide arbitrary information to the clients, as described above.  It
needn't be related to PVT in any way (e.g., battery charge info).

&gt;<i>  In particular, it doesn't save us
</I>&gt;<i> from being stuck with the nasty latency vs. jitter problem created by
</I>&gt;<i> having more than one report per cycle.
</I>
   Hmm... As I described it above, the client could define its reports
any way it likes, so it could lump every bit of info it needs in a
single message.  Wouldn't that solve the jitter problem?  Additionally,
if you trigger the report &quot;on change&quot;, defining &quot;change&quot; as a variation
on *any* of the data contained in the report (perhaps other than time),
then you would also solve the latency problem, albeit at the expense of
having some potentially stale data on some reports.

   I will have to think about it a bit more.  In any case, I am not
passionate about any of the above, just throwing ideas into the wind in
case they may actually make some kind of sense.


Regards,
Diego Berge.
