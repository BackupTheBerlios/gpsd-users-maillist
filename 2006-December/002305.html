<PRE>Chris Kuethe &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-users">chris.kuethe at gmail.com</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> &gt; Off the top of my head, I can't think of anything else other than the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; quality indicators already present (DGPS status, RMS, DOPs), except perhaps
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that you would want to include some extra output such as vectors to the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; base station and status info. But as I said, I would have to have a think
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; about it when I am properly rested.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Hm. That'll require a different message format. For now, the O message
</I>&gt;<i> (7DOF PVT solution with 95% confidence intervals) is what we've got.
</I>&gt;<i> It's a good format. We're not dismissing this extra RTK metadata
</I>&gt;<i> outright, but I don't think it has a place in the standard PVT report.
</I>
However, one of the ways we may end up extending O is by adding
optional private-use fields to the end of the report.  These would be
used for numeric metadata that is closely coupled to a PVT report --
for example, water depth or temperature.

Those would differ from the separate GPSD-NG queries, which would be
for things like satellite ephemeris data *not* closely associated 
with an individual PVT report.
 
&gt;<i> Stick around though - you can help us with the Next Generation
</I>&gt;<i> Protocol. As an actual user of RTK gear, you can tell us whether or
</I>&gt;<i> not a message format contains enough useful information.
</I>
Seconded.   You're  the  first of  a  class  of  user that  we'd  been
anticipating for some time, so we would try to learn from your reports
even if you seemed fairly clueless.  Since you've both shown that you write
good craftsmanlike  code and shown signs of  having considerable domain
expertise, you will get our most respectful attention.

&gt;<i> &gt; btw, I've just had another stupid idea (RINEX output) but I'd rather not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; mention it until I'm back from leave in two weeks time. :P
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That's hardly stupid. If you read the archives of gpsd-users and
</I>&gt;<i> gpsd-dev and you will see that I've been mulling that over for some
</I>&gt;<i> time. I've tried to restrict my gps purchases to hardware that does
</I>&gt;<i> actually give me carrier phase and pseudorange so I can hack on this
</I>&gt;<i> sort of thing.
</I>
And, in fact, RINEX output has been one of my long-term to-do items since
before I recruited Chris onto the project.

Now I'll give you the same pitch I gave Chris.  My long-term vision,
expressed in our Hacking Guide, is to go beyond GPS monitoring and
produce a complete set of open-source inspection and test tools for
GPS programming. Just as the project site has developed into a one-stop 
programmer's reference for GPS-aware development, I want our codebase
to competently handle *everything* GPS below the application level.

That means supporting DGPS, supporting RINEX output, bulding a capable
software GPS simulator, and even building an open-source firmware upgrader 
for GPS chipsets.

You show every sign of being someone we want on our core team.  You want
RINEX?  Fine!  Have a little patience until 2.34 ships; after that, Chris 
and I will be happy to work on it with you.
