<PRE>Andre Naujoks &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-users">nautsch2 at googlemail.com</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> &gt; 1. An Ntrip RTCM2 log you gave me (test/daemon/naujoks-ntrip.log) begins
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; with a type 14 sentence.  I'm pretty sure my decode of it is good
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; because it ends with leapsecs:15.  Of course it's still possible I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; have got previous bitfield boundaries wrong.  Note that I do *not*
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; know that any of the following type 1 messages in that file are decoded
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; correctly, and I have no idea why I'm seeing type 31s.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Type 14 you say? The Sourcetable says it should contain only 1, 3, 16 and 31
</I>
I think the sourcetable is wrong.  Type 14s are expected to be shipped
at start of data transmission in order to provide a time reference
that disambiguates the zcount fields in following sentences. So that
type 14 is appearing where it's expected and has data in it that
looks right.
 
&gt;<i> You have to remove the first 4 bytes of the binary part.
</I>&gt;<i> The rest should be pure rtcm2. I'll try to get you something bigger.
</I>
Thanks.  Do you have any idea what's in the Type 31s?

&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;   I think I remember some tool out there, that decodes rtcm2. I may be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; able to use that to offer some help.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It may have been called rtcmdecode and may have been written by you ... so 
</I>&gt;<i> kudos to you. It doesn't help in this case however. :-)
</I>
No.  That's gpsdecode from back before it did AIS.  The dump format was
an idiosyncratic non-JSON thing designed by John Sager (it's gone now).

&gt;<i> I meant extraction of single packets from a stream to use as test data.
</I>&gt;<i> If the driver_rtcm2 could dump the data, the task would indeed be almost
</I>&gt;<i> trivial.
</I>
I don't need the binary part of the test pair to be packetized.  A raw
RTCM2 stream and a correponding dump of the packet sequence will do, if we
can find anything that will generate that.

&gt;<i> I looked through this one a little. It looks documented, but I am not
</I>&gt;<i> seeing a complete rtcm parser with all the kinks and bits.

</I>&gt;<i> Under &quot;Multi-Function Ntrip Software and Assisting Tools&quot; The first tool.
</I>&gt;<i> theres C++ Source code under GPL.

</I>
That's BNC.  It's part of the tree I downloaded.  The whole thing seems to
have beenm produced by some German federal agency in charge of mapping
and geodesics.

If you found documentation for it you are doing better than I did.
What's the URL for the documentation?

&gt;<i> There is also an rtcm windows binary. I am not sure what exactly it does,
</I>&gt;<i> but maybe its worth looking at.
</I>
I have no Windows machines handy.
