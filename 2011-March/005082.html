I don't see it in the git repo yet. But with that minor patch it works
for me.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Since you work with Ntrip streams, I'm wondering if you can supply us
</I>&gt;<i> with something we badly need - better test loads.  Right now I have to
</I>&gt;<i> take correct functioning of our RTCM2 and RTCM3 analyzers almost
</I>&gt;<i> entirely on faith - I have exactly one (1) verified combination of an
</I>&gt;<i> RTCM3 packet and analyzed data to work with and none at all for RTCM2.
</I>
I'll get back to you on that. I don't really know, if I am allowed to do
that, but I will try.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What we need, for each protocol, is a representative list of binary
</I>&gt;<i> packets paired with dumps of the data in them is a human-readable 
</I>&gt;<i> format.  Can you put together such pairs?
</I>
If I can send RTCM sentences, I could give the accompanying gpspipe
output ... but that wouldn't make any sense for testing purposes, would
it? I think I remember some tool out there, that decodes rtcm2. I may be
able to use that to offer some help.

I am not sure about packets though. RTCM2 is not byte based, but 30bit
word based and there is no padding between words and/or packets as far
as I am aware of. It could be quite hard to extract packets from that.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Being able to eyeball-check gpsd's results against the output
</I>&gt;<i> from another analyzer would be hugely useful.
</I>
Do you have a specific analyzer in mind?
