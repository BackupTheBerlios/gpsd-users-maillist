</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 1. An Ntrip RTCM2 log you gave me (test/daemon/naujoks-ntrip.log) begins
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> with a type 14 sentence.  I'm pretty sure my decode of it is good
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> because it ends with leapsecs:15.  Of course it's still possible I
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> have got previous bitfield boundaries wrong.  Note that I do *not*
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> know that any of the following type 1 messages in that file are decoded
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> correctly, and I have no idea why I'm seeing type 31s.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Type 14 you say? The Sourcetable says it should contain only 1, 3, 16 and 31
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think the sourcetable is wrong.  Type 14s are expected to be shipped
</I>&gt;<i> at start of data transmission in order to provide a time reference
</I>&gt;<i> that disambiguates the zcount fields in following sentences. So that
</I>&gt;<i> type 14 is appearing where it's expected and has data in it that
</I>&gt;<i> looks right.
</I>
That the sourcetable might be wrong is totally possible. They *are*
sending &quot;RTCM_&quot; format. So maybe thats broken somehow, too.

I attached a somewhat longer data dump. This time only the data, the
NTRIP server sent. I will try to pipe this through the windows binary I
mentioned tonight and tell you if it worked.

&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> You have to remove the first 4 bytes of the binary part.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The rest should be pure rtcm2. I'll try to get you something bigger.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks.  Do you have any idea what's in the Type 31s?
</I>

(something rtcm tooly) says that 31 is like 1 only for GLONASS corrections.

I don't think it is possible to implement this fully without the
specifications from rtcm.org. Could we somehow make a fund raiser and
just buy those? I would give some money. If 10 people give 10&#8364; the
specification is payed for. On the other hand, I don't know the
implications of releasing an open source tool with those closed specs used.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>   I think I remember some tool out there, that decodes rtcm2. I may be
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> able to use that to offer some help.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It may have been called rtcmdecode and may have been written by you ... so 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> kudos to you. It doesn't help in this case however. :-)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> No.  That's gpsdecode from back before it did AIS.  The dump format was
</I>&gt;<i> an idiosyncratic non-JSON thing designed by John Sager (it's gone now).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I meant extraction of single packets from a stream to use as test data.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If the driver_rtcm2 could dump the data, the task would indeed be almost
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> trivial.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I don't need the binary part of the test pair to be packetized.  A raw
</I>&gt;<i> RTCM2 stream and a correponding dump of the packet sequence will do, if we
</I>&gt;<i> can find anything that will generate that.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I looked through this one a little. It looks documented, but I am not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> seeing a complete rtcm parser with all the kinks and bits.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That's BNC.  It's part of the tree I downloaded.  The whole thing seems to
</I>&gt;<i> have beenm produced by some German federal agency in charge of mapping
</I>&gt;<i> and geodesics.
</I>
NTRIP was developed by those guys as far as I remember.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If you found documentation for it you are doing better than I did.
</I>&gt;<i> What's the URL for the documentation?
</I>
Just source code documentation in the RTCM directory. But as I said, no
in deep rtcm decoder there. Sorry.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> There is also an rtcm windows binary. I am not sure what exactly it does,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> but maybe its worth looking at.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I have no Windows machines handy.
</I>
I'll give it a try tonight.
