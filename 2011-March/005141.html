<PRE>Andre Naujoks &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-users">nautsch2 at googlemail.com</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> This (attachement) is what the tool spat out. I hope it helps. I have
</I>&gt;<i> not really an idea what RINEX looks like and this could very well be
</I>&gt;<i> just another dump of that.
</I>
It took a lot of work, and I was puzzled for a while by the fact that
the report boundaries of the ASCII dump didn't quite match the packet
bounaries of the binary RTCM data it was made from, but I have managed
to check our JSON against that dump.

Rather to my surprise it appears our RTCM2 driver is *exactly*
correct, at least for types 1, 3, 9, 14, 16, and 31.  Because of the
way the driver is structured, this gives me certainty about the
null-message type 6 and pretty high confidence in the decoding of
remaining types 5, 7, and 13.  Of course it would be better if we had
test loads for those, too.

This is quite surprising because, other than one very ancient dump
file of a handful of type 9 sentences put together by John Sager for
DGPSIP well before this project existed, we never really had a test
for this case before. The RTCM2 packet analyzer is full of
complicated, fragile bit-twidding, and the ISGPS bit-sync layer
underneath it is worse.  By all odds, it *shouldn't* have been
correct.

Nevertheless, the dump seems to establish that we somehow managed to
get it right on the first try five years ago and it hasn't bit-rotted
since.  The more I think about this the more utterly astonishing it
seems.  Yay for regression testing.

Now we need the same sort of test pair for RTCM3.
