I don't think there is a use case, that is not possible either way.

The blocking would be simpler and more intuitive, than to loop around
with a gps_waiting(). IMHO(!) any read should block. Only if you
explicitly say otherwise it should be non-blocking.

If you have a non-interactive programm, which has gps as the only data
source, then you add a call to this program by not allowing a blocking
read. Thats about it. I don't think this is super bad. With a POLL_BLOCK
you could do:

open gps
loop {
  read gps
  do your thing.
}

Now you have to

open gps
loop {
  check for data
  read gps
  do your thing.
}

As I said, this is a really small thing. Still less intuitive than a
blocking approach, but really small and I could live with it. ... I
would still use select though just because it is easier to read and
understand what is done.

This should be really well documented and made clear on release, because
it behaves differently from everything I ever used.
