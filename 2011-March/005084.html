I tried to bury the reset of the conn_state as deep as possible in the chain
of ntrip calls to make the smallest impact possible on the rest of the code.

conn_state has to be reset before a connection is initiated.

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> format.  Can you put together such pairs?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If I can send RTCM sentences, I could give the accompanying gpspipe
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> output ... but that wouldn't make any sense for testing purposes, would
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> No.  The whole point is to verify gpsd against decodes that are *known* good.
</I>&gt;<i> I don't know that GPSD's code is right; that's exactly what's bothering me.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Here is *everything* I currently know about this:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1. An Ntrip RTCM2 log you gave me (test/daemon/naujoks-ntrip.log) begins
</I>&gt;<i> with a type 14 sentence.  I'm pretty sure my decode of it is good
</I>&gt;<i> because it ends with leapsecs:15.  Of course it's still possible I
</I>&gt;<i> have got previous bitfield boundaries wrong.  Note that I do *not*
</I>&gt;<i> know that any of the following type 1 messages in that file are decoded
</I>&gt;<i> correctly, and I have no idea why I'm seeing type 31s.
</I>
Type 14 you say? The Sourcetable says it should contain only 1, 3, 16 and 31

You have to remove the first 4 bytes of the binary part.
The rest should be pure rtcm2. I'll try to get you something bigger.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 2. The RTCM3.1 standard includes a hexdump of a type 1029 message
</I>&gt;<i> and a complete decode.  GPSD matches this decode exactly so I'm
</I>&gt;<i> pretty sure I have this type right.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 3. The RTCM3.1 standard includes a hexdump of a type 1005 message
</I>&gt;<i> and a complete decode. My decoder gets *almost* all fields correct
</I>&gt;<i> - but this one drives me crazy because I get ECEF-Y right and the
</I>&gt;<i> ECEF-X and ECEF-Z fields on either side of it wrong.  I can't figure
</I>&gt;<i> out why - all three are 38-bit signed and the field lengths of 
</I>&gt;<i> everything else look right.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 4. ckuethe gave me three Ntrip samples from RTCM3 Ntrip casters.  My
</I>&gt;<i> decoder gets only garbage from them - lots of skips and a few packets
</I>&gt;<i> with impossible message numbers.  This is weirder because one thing I am
</I>&gt;<i> pretty sure of is that the sniffer assembles RTCM3 packets correctly
</I>&gt;<i> (it does the right thing on 2 and 3).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 5. All other RTCM2 and RTCM3 packet type decodes to JSON are
</I>&gt;<i> *completely unverified*.  This bothers me a lot.  I've been searching
</I>&gt;<i> for decent test datasets for years, fruitlessly so far.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   I think I remember some tool out there, that decodes rtcm2. I may be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> able to use that to offer some help.
</I>
It may have been called rtcmdecode and may have been written by you ... so 
kudos to you. It doesn't help in this case however. :-)

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That's the sort of thing I need, yes.  Readable dumps made using a known-good
</I>&gt;<i> decoder, and the binary they were made from.  Ideally, with a representative 
</I>&gt;<i> sample of all packet types.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I am not sure about packets though. RTCM2 is not byte based, but 30bit
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> word based and there is no padding between words and/or packets as far
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> as I am aware of. It could be quite hard to extract packets from that.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Actually it's not that bad.  You segregate out RTCM2 packets by
</I>&gt;<i> syncing to the ISGPS bitstream in a particular way, looking for leader
</I>&gt;<i> characters guarded by 6-bit parity.  The code to do it is very nasty,
</I>&gt;<i> but thanks to work by Wolfgang Rupprecht (the DGPSIP guy) and later by
</I>&gt;<i> myself, GPSD has been able to turn this trick for years; the relevant
</I>&gt;<i> code is in isgps.c.  It gives back sequences of 30-bit words which you
</I>&gt;<i> then pull bitfields out of - see driver_rtcm2.c for an example.
</I>
I meant extraction of single packets from a stream to use as test data.
If the driver_rtcm2 could dump the data, the task would indeed be almost
trivial.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I am pretty sure my RTCM2 and RTCM3 packetizers are good.  It's the
</I>&gt;<i> layer above that, the bitfield extractions, that I have been unable 
</I>&gt;<i> to verify.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Being able to eyeball-check gpsd's results against the output
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> from another analyzer would be hugely useful.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Do you have a specific analyzer in mind?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I only know of one - the rtcm-ntrip.org suite, which I've grabbed the
</I>&gt;<i> code tree for.  Trouble is, (1) it's not documented.  At *all*.  (2)
</I>&gt;<i> I see no Makefiles and can't figure out how to build it, and (3) I
</I>&gt;<i> don't see a dump utility in there.  The closest approximation I've
</I>&gt;<i> found is a translator to RINEX, which is only a partial dump.
</I>
I looked through this one a little. It looks documented, but I am not
seeing a complete rtcm parser with all the kinks and bits.

<A HREF="http://igs.bkg.bund.de/ntrip/download">http://igs.bkg.bund.de/ntrip/download</A>

Under &quot;Multi-Function Ntrip Software and Assisting Tools&quot; The first tool.
theres C++ Source code under GPL.

There is also an rtcm windows binary. I am not sure what exactly it does,
but maybe its worth looking at.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> How in the hell do other people check their decoders?  *Somebody*
</I>&gt;<i> must have a decent test set, but I've been unable to find it.
</I>
I guess its all in the hell of proprietary, closed source software. ;-)

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> (I had similar troubles with AIS, but with helpo from Kurt Schewhr
</I>&gt;<i> I managed to put together a decent - though still not entirely complete 
</I>&gt;<i> - test set. See test/sample.aivdm.)
