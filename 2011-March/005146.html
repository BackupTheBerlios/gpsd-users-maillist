</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This (attachement) is what the tool spat out. I hope it helps. I have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> not really an idea what RINEX looks like and this could very well be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> just another dump of that.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It took a lot of work, and I was puzzled for a while by the fact that
</I>&gt;<i> the report boundaries of the ASCII dump didn't quite match the packet

</I>&gt;<i> to check our JSON against that dump.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Rather to my surprise it appears our RTCM2 driver is *exactly*
</I>&gt;<i> correct, at least for types 1, 3, 9, 14, 16, and 31.  Because of the
</I>&gt;<i> way the driver is structured, this gives me certainty about the
</I>&gt;<i> null-message type 6 and pretty high confidence in the decoding of
</I>&gt;<i> remaining types 5, 7, and 13.  Of course it would be better if we had
</I>&gt;<i> test loads for those, too.
</I>
I am very glad to hear that.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This is quite surprising because, other than one very ancient dump
</I>&gt;<i> file of a handful of type 9 sentences put together by John Sager for
</I>&gt;<i> DGPSIP well before this project existed, we never really had a test
</I>&gt;<i> for this case before. The RTCM2 packet analyzer is full of
</I>&gt;<i> complicated, fragile bit-twidding, and the ISGPS bit-sync layer
</I>&gt;<i> underneath it is worse.  By all odds, it *shouldn't* have been
</I>&gt;<i> correct.
</I>
Well, rtcm2 is full of fragile and complicated bit-twiddling ;-)

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Nevertheless, the dump seems to establish that we somehow managed to
</I>&gt;<i> get it right on the first try five years ago and it hasn't bit-rotted
</I>&gt;<i> since.  The more I think about this the more utterly astonishing it
</I>&gt;<i> seems.  Yay for regression testing.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Now we need the same sort of test pair for RTCM3.
</I>
... I can give the same tool a try with the rtcm3 tests in the git repo!?
