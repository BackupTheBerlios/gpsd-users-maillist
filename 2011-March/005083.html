Please resend.

</I>
No.  The whole point is to verify gpsd against decodes that are *known* good.
I don't know that GPSD's code is right; that's exactly what's bothering me.

Here is *everything* I currently know about this:

1. An Ntrip RTCM2 log you gave me (test/daemon/naujoks-ntrip.log) begins
with a type 14 sentence.  I'm pretty sure my decode of it is good
because it ends with leapsecs:15.  Of course it's still possible I
have got previous bitfield boundaries wrong.  Note that I do *not*
know that any of the following type 1 messages in that file are decoded
correctly, and I have no idea why I'm seeing type 31s.

2. The RTCM3.1 standard includes a hexdump of a type 1029 message
and a complete decode.  GPSD matches this decode exactly so I'm
pretty sure I have this type right.

3. The RTCM3.1 standard includes a hexdump of a type 1005 message
and a complete decode. My decoder gets *almost* all fields correct
- but this one drives me crazy because I get ECEF-Y right and the
ECEF-X and ECEF-Z fields on either side of it wrong.  I can't figure
out why - all three are 38-bit signed and the field lengths of 
everything else look right.

4. ckuethe gave me three Ntrip samples from RTCM3 Ntrip casters.  My
decoder gets only garbage from them - lots of skips and a few packets
with impossible message numbers.  This is weirder because one thing I am
pretty sure of is that the sniffer assembles RTCM3 packets correctly
(it does the right thing on 2 and 3).

5. All other RTCM2 and RTCM3 packet type decodes to JSON are
*completely unverified*.  This bothers me a lot.  I've been searching
for decent test datasets for years, fruitlessly so far.

&gt;<i>   I think I remember some tool out there, that decodes rtcm2. I may be
</I>&gt;<i> able to use that to offer some help.
</I>
That's the sort of thing I need, yes.  Readable dumps made using a known-good
decoder, and the binary they were made from.  Ideally, with a representative 
sample of all packet types.

&gt;<i> I am not sure about packets though. RTCM2 is not byte based, but 30bit
</I>&gt;<i> word based and there is no padding between words and/or packets as far
</I>&gt;<i> as I am aware of. It could be quite hard to extract packets from that.
</I>
Actually it's not that bad.  You segregate out RTCM2 packets by
syncing to the ISGPS bitstream in a particular way, looking for leader
characters guarded by 6-bit parity.  The code to do it is very nasty,
but thanks to work by Wolfgang Rupprecht (the DGPSIP guy) and later by
myself, GPSD has been able to turn this trick for years; the relevant
code is in isgps.c.  It gives back sequences of 30-bit words which you
then pull bitfields out of - see driver_rtcm2.c for an example.

I am pretty sure my RTCM2 and RTCM3 packetizers are good.  It's the
layer above that, the bitfield extractions, that I have been unable 
to verify.

&gt;<i> &gt; Being able to eyeball-check gpsd's results against the output
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; from another analyzer would be hugely useful.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Do you have a specific analyzer in mind?
</I>
I only know of one - the rtcm-ntrip.org suite, which I've grabbed the
code tree for.  Trouble is, (1) it's not documented.  At *all*.  (2)
I see no Makefiles and can't figure out how to build it, and (3) I
don't see a dump utility in there.  The closest approximation I've
found is a translator to RINEX, which is only a partial dump.

How in the hell do other people check their decoders?  *Somebody*
must have a decent test set, but I've been unable to find it.

(I had similar troubles with AIS, but with helpo from Kurt Schewhr
I managed to put together a decent - though still not entirely complete 
- test set. See test/sample.aivdm.)
