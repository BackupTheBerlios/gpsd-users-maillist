<PRE>Quoting Mamoru Yamamoto &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-users">yamamoto at rish.kyoto-u.ac.jp</A>&gt;:

&gt;<i> To my following questions I got three replies.  One was posted
</I>&gt;<i> on this mailing list.  They were all very informative.  ...
</I>
Thanks, but there's much that I still have to learn. For example,  
after a talk with a more knowledgeable friend this afternoon, my  
understanding now is that when combining Internet time sources with  
ntpd, three server entries is the minimum, because this is the only  
way that it can calculate a time average, discard the server that is  
furthest from this value, and then still have two servers left. After  
that, ntpd decides which server to synchronize with to based on other  
values, such as jitter.

However, if no Internet time sources are used and your only time  
source is a Garmin GPS 18 LVC, I have not yet managed to find any  
reason why ntpd should not sync with it. The only thing you must be  
sure of is that the Garmin GPS device always has a valid position fix.  
One of the keys to success here is proper positioning. I've written  
about this issue here:

    * Synchronizing ntpd to a Garmin GPS 18 LVC via gpsd
      <A HREF="http://www.rjsystems.nl/en/2100-ntpd-garmin-gps-18-lvc-gpsd.php#posi">http://www.rjsystems.nl/en/2100-ntpd-garmin-gps-18-lvc-gpsd.php#posi</A>

Also, if you have the gpsd-clients package installed, you can  
determine the position fix status of your Garmin device with the  
&quot;gpspipe -r&quot; command and examining the lines that start with $GPRMC  
(sent once per second by default), for example:

    $GPRMC,154052,A,5209.2345,N,00428.9922,E,000.0,145.9,090510,001.0,W*66

The second field is for the status. &quot;A&quot; represents &quot;valid position&quot;  
(good), while &quot;V&quot; is &quot;NAV receiver warning&quot; (not good). Basically, you  
never want to see a status &quot;V.&quot; If the device has just been turned on  
and it has yet to acquire a position fix, it will not even produce a  
pulse per second (PPS) signal.

On the other hand, if the device has previously acquired a position  
fix and is giving a PPS signal, but then loses its fix, it will  
continue to provide a PPS signal. However, its timing accuracy will  
then be degraded considerably.

Cheers,

Jaap
