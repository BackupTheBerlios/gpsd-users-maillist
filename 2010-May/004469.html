<PRE>Quoting Mamoru Yamamoto &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-users">yamamoto at rish.kyoto-u.ac.jp</A>&gt;:

&gt;<i> The ON time is short, and is sometimes only 1-2 times in an hour.
</I>&gt;<i> Under this situation, the PC clock itself looks stable enough.
</I>&gt;<i> When the NTP has another network reference, it is very nicely
</I>&gt;<i> synchronized to SHM(1).  Is this behavior correct?
</I>
I believe ntpd works best if there are at least three time sources  
listed in ntp.conf. However, if your stratum 0 time server has only  
one local time source and it gets disconnected from the network (and  
the other NTP servers), it should continue to work... unless you are  
forced to reboot your machine before the network connection is  
restored. This situation can be remedied by adding two more local time  
sources, such as another GPS and a longwave radio time signal receiver  
(e.g. the JJY signal in Japan).

Personally, I'm making do with only one other time source -- a DCF77  
receiver -- but I haven't really put the system to the test. If worst  
comes to worst, perhaps ntpd will count my own Garmin GPS 18 LVC's PPS  
and the NMEA signals as two different sources.

&gt;<i> (2) NTP start problem
</I>&gt;<i> At the same condition (NTP only with gpsd), NTP synchronization
</I>&gt;<i> does not start if the PC clock is several minutes (maybe) or
</I>&gt;<i> further off the correct timing.  To overcome this problem,
</I>&gt;<i> I made another small program to set the PC clock to GPS clock
</I>&gt;<i> readings if they are 10s or more different.
</I>&gt;<i> Is this the normal behavior of NTP?
</I>
The manual states if there is a difference of more than 1000 seconds  
between the local system and the the remote NTP server, ntpd will  
assume something is wrong and refuse to synchronize. After all, it has  
no way to tell whether the problem is local or remote. My impression  
has been that problems can arise with smaller differences, but that  
may also have been due to my own impatience.

Cheers,

Jaap
