</I>
Don't do that.  Instead, install the chrpath(1) tool on your
development system and the problem will vanish.

Explanation: The problem stems from the rpath feature of
shared-library loading, and arise because the GPSD programs rely on
two shared libaries - libgps (client) and libgpsd (low-level device
access).

A binary that uses shared libraries needs to tell the OS where to look
for them; this is a list of directories called an 'rpath'.  There's a
default rpath, which typically includes /lib and /usr/lib; you can add
directories to this by setting the RPATH environment variable at link
time.

For purposes of running regressions and other tests in the build
directory *before* the point at which shared libraries are installed
in /lib or /usr/lib, it is convenient to include $PWD or '.' in the
build path.  But we do *not* want this rpath to remain in the
installed binaries; with it, a maliciously crafted library dropped in
the right place might be used for privilege-escalation attacks and
other mischief. In the installed binaries, we want the default rpath
(/lib, /usr/lib, etc.)

The are only two known ways to get around this problem.  One is
libtool's; it does weird magic, producing under the name of each
binary a thing that is actually a shellscript that links the the
binary's components with RPATH='.' and then loading and running that.
This is why running gdb on a 'binary' with non-static linking produces
cryptic messages about the file type.  Then, libtool does an entire
second link pass with a different (default) rpath at binary
installation

The other way is to hack the rpath in the installed binaries *after
they're installed* to remove $PWD.  This is what chrpath does forn
us. If you have chrpath on your system, everything will behave as
you'd expect; in particular -lgpsd will find libgpsd in the build
directory.

If you don't have chrpath installed, life gets complicated.

In that case, the scons recipe never inserts $PWD in the rpath of each
binaries (in order to never produce a subvertible binary that might
get installed in sysyem space). This policy would make the link pass
unable to resolve -lgpsd to libgpsd in the build directory, except
that the scons recipe sets LD_LIBRARY PATH to $CWD in the environment
it passes to commands.  This behaves as a temporary addition to the
rpath, and means that you can run scons testregress without truoble.

The only case in which you still lose is if (a) you don't have chrpath,
(b) you try to run one of the programs by hand rather than through the 
scons test wraapper, and (c) you don't already have the shared 
libraries installed in system space

This is a price we pay for dumping autotools - specifically, 
libtool - over the side. It's such as nasty pile of hacks that
I think that's a good trade.

To sum up and repeat: Install chrpath(1).  That should fix the problem.
