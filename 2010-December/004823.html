I figured it worked perfectly for you but not for me. Yeah, this thing
uses a pl2303 serial to USB adapter.

Some suggestions:

* Can gpsd watch the delivery rate of data for several seconds before
  turning on that feature, then watch it after? If so, that will tell
  you if it is working correctly? If it is hideously slow, fall back.
  This would provide for a jerky startup, so I would note it somewhere,
  but at least it would work without operator or other intevention. It
  would work for me, but might not for other folks. At a rough guess it
  might take 30-60 seconds to empty the pipeline.

* A compile time switch to manually enable your subframe code. It's
  ugly, but it gets you there. This avoids the jerky startup. It's
  likely to cause problems for distribution packagers, so (on the
  hypothesis that most of their users aren't interested in the the
  subframe data, or wouldn't notice its absence) I'd suggest the
  default be off.

* I suppose I could ask Globalsat if they have a fix for the problem.
  Sure, and maybe the Irish will build a monument to Cromwell.

* I could buy a new GPS receiver. That would solve my problem, but not
  the problem of other BU-353 owners, who wouldn't be able to diagnose
  the problem as I did.

Thoughts?
