I'm experimenting with trying to detect bad behavior like the Placer's
in the NMEA driver.  The goal is to latch mode to 1 on a non-advancing
timestamp; it will be up to the PPS code to notice when mode goes to 1
and stop sending updates to ntpd (or whatever else needs to happen).

I've never seen a receiver issue GSA twice in the same reporting cycle
and would lay long odds against that ever happening. Therefore, if GSA
had a timestamp, I would have been quite be willing to add a bit of
logic that compares each timestamp to the last one and forces mode to
1 if they're identical. This would suppress fix reporting until the
mode really changes.  The problem is that GSA in fact has no
timestamp.

We can make the same once-per-cycle assumption more fruitfully with
GGA; it does in fact have a timestamp.  Trouble is, the next GSA
changes the mode to a bogus value again.  The only way to prevent this
is with a latch variable that gets set on a non-advancing GGA and
cleared on an advancing GGA, and suppresses the mode change from GSA
when set.

That sort of stateful processing is quite bug-prone, however.  Also,
the attempt breaks 6 of our 44 regression tests. I'm going to need
awhile and some careful eyeballing of logs to decide whether or
not the attempt is both correct and safe.
