<PRE>Hi

Responding to a set of replies that I received in the DIGEST:


&gt;<i> As Eric said, the whole point of gpsd is that it manages the
</I>&gt;<i> device on its own. That's what it does, that's what it's
</I>&gt;<i> designed to do.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Once you start allowing other tools to write to the receiver
</I>&gt;<i> too, you enter a world of pain as gpsd is no longer able to
</I>&gt;<i> guarantee that the receiver is in the state that it's asked
</I>&gt;<i> it to be in. It's just completely intractable.
</I>
I agree that state management could become a pain, but in most cases it will
not be a pain.
Currently the pain is that GPSD monopolises the port.
BT747 does a lot more than retrieving current position data - it retrieves
stored data logs and allows configuration of log conditions, etc.
BT747 is also multiplatform - including Windows and mobile devices, so the
intent is not to leave NMEA analysis out.  The NMEA analysis is mainly there
for the control commands/replies anyway.

&gt;<i> Methinks ESR mean &quot;hack&quot; as a compliment.
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html">http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html</A>
</I>
I am a hacker.  It's just that I consider hacking to be the act of modifying
an existing system to overcome a limit in a way that was not intended in the
original design.


&gt;<i> To be clear, BT747 should go through libgps, not direct to gpsd itself.
</I>&gt;<i> Then you leave all the intricacies of the vendor's mangling of NMEA,
</I>&gt;<i> etc. to gpsd, and the BT747 code is a lot cleaner.
</I>
BT747 probably has more NMEA mangling regarding MTK devices than GPSD does.

&gt;<i> A Java wrapper around libgps shouldn't be too hard to do. I would
</I>&gt;<i> suggest a set of factory classes to produce beans with the various
</I>&gt;<i> types of data libgps produces, per the &quot;set&quot; bit mask in struct
</I>&gt;<i> gps_data_t (gps.h), or maybe just the interesting ones. Do that up
</I>&gt;<i> right, and any gpsd client written in Java could use it.
</I>
I agree that such a thing would be a reuseable component.  Native libraries
are a pain though in Java because you need a build for every system and the
idea is to avoid that.  So using standard mechanism known by Java makes that
more portable.  'Unix domain sockets' are not part of that standard.

&gt;<i> On a quick check of the gpsd hardware compatibility list
</I>&gt;<i> (<A HREF="http://gpsd.berlios.de/hardware.html">http://gpsd.berlios.de/hardware.html</A>), I don't see any BT747 devices
</I>&gt;<i> there. This may be because no-one has tested any with gpsd. I'd be
</I>&gt;<i> curious to see how they fare together.
</I>There is one or two (M-241 for instance).

&gt;<i> If I understand what I read on the BT747 page, BT747 is capable of
</I>&gt;<i> pulling logging data from a compatible receiver. Does gpsd support
</I>&gt;<i>anything like that?
</I>I don't think GPSD is doing that, but I am not a GPSD expert.

&gt;&gt;<i> A pity that this control port is a unix domain socket and not a TCP
</I>socket.
&gt;&gt;<i>   I do not think that security will be hurt a lot if it were a TCP socket
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> listening on 127.0.0.1 only (accepting from the localhost only, and not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> listening on the public IP address).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Why? Why add the overhead of going through the network stack
</I>&gt;<i>-- even if you're avoiding the physical drivers -- if you're
</I>&gt;<i>just doing local IPC?
</I>
 I need the reply from the device. and I did not see the equivalent of a
'?WATCH' command in the Control Socket Commands.

&gt;<i> Unix domain sockets are fine.
</I>But not supported by default in java and not so commonly used.

&gt;&gt;<i> After connecting to the Unix socket @/var/run/gps.sock , I got 'OK'
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> responses, but no reaction from the device.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I requested a cold start using:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> !/dev/ttyS0=$PMTK103*30
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and I also tried the hex equivalent using '&amp;'.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I got an 'OK' each time, but the device did not 'cold start'.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Your device is probably expecting a newline after
</I>&gt;<i>&quot;$PMTK103*30&quot;. I suggest hex-encoding the entire string
</I>&gt;<i>&quot;$PMTK103*30\n&quot; and sending it with the '&amp;' variant.
</I>
I already tried the hex encoding, including concatenating the command
several times in the same '&amp;' call so that at least one of them was preceded
by a 0d0a  (A \n is not always sufficient - \r\n is more complete).
So I also did something like:
&amp;/dev/ttyS0=24504d544b3130332a33300d0a24504d544b3130332a33300d0a24504d544b3130332a33300d0a

And I did it as 'root' to avoid any potential restriction of rights on the
unix domain socket.  Given the I got an 'OK' response (and sometimes ERROR
when not putting the right command), I conclude that write and read both
worked.

So I guess I'll have to resort to some serial protocol sniffing to see what
is really sent (supposing that something was sent).

Kind regards

Mario
