With a few exceptions - novatel and ublox come to mind - most
receivers have some RS232-ish serial output connected to a more
plug-n-play bridge chip (FTDI, Prolific, SiLabs, Cambridge
Silicon,...).

UBX, NovAtel and others that implement CDC-ACM don't have any real
speed. You can configure the port to the lowest speed supported by
your termios implementation and you'll still be able to spew PVT and
debug data with time to spare, as long as the data rate is less than
usb link speed.

But such devices are rare. If you're talking to a more common setup,
then you have to send a gps protocol message to tell the receiver to
use a certain serial format, and then send a usb or bluetooth message
to tell the bridge chip to match this format. Here, speed does matter;
if the bridge chip is configured incorrectly, you won't be able to
talk to the receiver chip. Some bluetooth chips don't support changing
serial speed either, but you can still send the receiver configuration
message. Oops, now you can't talk to the chip at all - that's how we
came to have the '-b' flag.

I guess this might come down to cost. I think all production receivers
are based around ARM IP (I knew of one, now defunct, vendor producing
SPARC based receivers). In the short term, it probably saves money to
not synthesize a USB transceiver, to not add USB support into the
firmware and to not pay USB-IF fees. &quot;We make GPS receiver chips.
Interfacing to other stuff... that's our customers' decision.&quot;

So RS232 speed matters, if only because your local termios calls are
translated to device specific configuration commands.

GDB has a 'break' feature; why doesn't it have 'fix' too?
