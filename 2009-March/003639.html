<PRE>Eric Fowler &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-users">eric.fowler at gmail.com</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> Well, guess what ... I need to process AIS strings. So it looks like I will
</I>&gt;<i> be writing some code to handle those AIVDM packets. So I have a few
</I>&gt;<i> questions before I start:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1) Do you know of any code that will take that gobbledegook (e.g.
</I>&gt;<i> '177KQJ5000G?tOK&gt;RA1wUbN0TKH')
</I>&gt;<i> and process it into standard lat/long?
</I>
This might do it: &lt;<A HREF="http://www.aisparser.com/">http://www.aisparser.com/</A>&gt;. But it's closed source.
 
&gt;<i> 2) Is it more reasonable that this functionality live in the gpsd daemon at
</I>&gt;<i> all, or in a client? The case could be made that the daemon is intended to
</I>&gt;<i> track status of a &quot;device&quot; (boat, car, etc) that has the gps attached to it,
</I>&gt;<i> whereas AIS data can track several vessels at once, as well as static data
</I>&gt;<i> for the vessel (draft, tonnage, etc). This IMO is quite different from what
</I>&gt;<i> gpsd does right now. On the other hand, gpsd can interpret many kinds of
</I>&gt;<i> strings, so perhaps it stands to reason that AIS data is just one more kind
</I>&gt;<i> of string.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Opinions?
</I>
Not sure yet.  What I'd like to see is a copy of the AIVDM standard, but
I haven't yet found one that isn't behind a paywall.  There are some
clues at <A HREF="http://www.bosunsmate.org/ais/">http://www.bosunsmate.org/ais/</A>

It is at least theoretically possible that we might want to write an AIS
driver that unpacks some of these sentences into GPSD PVT reports. It doesn't
look like this would be very difficult, actually.

If you can get me a copy of that standard I'll rough-cut some code.
