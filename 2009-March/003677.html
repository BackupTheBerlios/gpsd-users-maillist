<PRE>With 2.39 shipping; it's time to plan ahead for the 2.40 release cycle.

The following projects are unfinished:

1. AIVDM/AIVDO decoding works and is tested in gpsdecode, but is not yet 
use or reported by gpsd in any way at all.

The AIDVM data doesn't quite fit inside an 'O' report, so this probably 
will not change until we define GPSD-NG, the new request/response protocol.

AIVDM is changing my thinking about the scope and semantics of GPSD's
behavior. In the past, GPSD has always been about kinematic awareness
of devices we presume to be local to where it's running.  With AIVDM,
GPSD could become an aggregator for kinematic data from remote sources
as well - Marine AIS transceivers, today, maybe aircraft transponders
tomorrow?

2. RTCM104v3 is passed to GPSes from RTCM104v3 sources, but the code for
analyzing RTCM3 packets and dumping them is incomplete smd untested.

I'm stalled on this because there is little point in trying to finish it
before I have a test load.  A test load would consist of a log of
representative RTCM3 packets *and* a falthful text dump of the data
in that log.  An RTCM3 log by itself is not sufficient because there's
no way to check it's being dumpred correctly.

The good news is that if I *had* such a test load, I could make this work 
in a day or two.

3. gpsflash is still in an untested pre-alpha state.

This is Chris Kuethe's baby. It's been hanging fire for a long time.
The trouble with this subproject is partly that it's expensive -- you need
a development kit with flash-to-RAM capoability, otherwise you risk toating
a lot of devices.  Partly it's that GPS makers keep a really close rein on
who can get their firmware images and how; theiy're copyrighted and the 
legal barriers are significant.

Chris has agreed to try to make a case to Google that it should foot the
bill for a SiRF devkit.  If nothing happens by 2.40 release we'll probably 
officially kill this subproject.

4. The GPS simulator, gpssim, needs a skyview calculator.

The blocker on this is that I need a way to compute a satellite skyview
from GPS satellite orbital elements, and don't have one.  Other than that,
the mathematical modeling is done and the report generation is pretty simple.

New projects:

1. D-Bus support

We've actually had rudimentary D-Bus support since 2005 -- one of our
test clients use it if it's available -- but it's poorly documenterd, 
obscure, and experimental

Recently we've been challenged by Gypsy, a competing GPS monitor
daemon with better D-Bus support as its main selling point.  It's a
pretty weak effort in most ways -- scratchy code, no packet sniffer --
but the author's ideas on how to use D-Bus seem sound.

It's not clear whether the right thing to do is exactly emulate 
the Gypsy D-Bus interface or build a better one of our own (and
a client library to go with it).

2. Dumping pseudorange and subframe information.

Some devices let you get this stuff.  For the drivers that can support
it, it will require about doublying the complexity of the packet
analyzer. We'll probably have to envent our own dump format, as the
quasi-standard RINEX is file-oriented rather than streaming.

This project needs GPSD-NG, so we'll have a way to encapsulate dump
messages.

3. GPSD-NG, the next-generation request/reponse protocol.

With full AIVDM support and pseudorange dumping moving to near the
top of the todo list, the day I've been putting off for two years
seems to be here -- it's time to design an improved request/reponse
protocol.  There are two major reasons for this:

1. We've run out of command letters

2. We're going need a way to encapsulate multline responses.

I'll expand on the design issues around this in another post.
