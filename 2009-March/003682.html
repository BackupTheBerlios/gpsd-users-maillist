<PRE>Kurt, you'll probably just have received my dev-list email on the
redesign of GPSD's request-response protocol.  This note is a heads-up
on the state of my AIVDM decoder.  I'm copying to GPSD's user list as
well; many of them may not be aware of the new capability.

I'm informing you about this because you are both my best information
source on AIVDM and, potentially, my first customer. I am aiming to
field AIVDM decoder tools that are open source, well tested, fast
(as in compiled-C-fast) and deployable in constrained environments
such as scientific instrumentation packages.

Here is the state of play:

* Currently, I decode messages of types 1,2,3,4,5,9, and 18.

* I have relied on your example sentence decodings to verify the 
decoder.

* The decoder's assumptions about the AIVDM format are fully documented 
at <A HREF="http://gpsd.berlios.de/AIVDM.html">http://gpsd.berlios.de/AIVDM.html</A>

* The decoder is accessible through a gpsdecode utility which filteres
AIVDM sentences on standard input to an un-armored dump on standard output.

* My output format is CSV.  Each line dumps message fields in the order
they occur in the message; spare bits are omitted.  String data is
decoded to ASCII, numeric data to numeric literals.  

* An output-mode option controls whether numeric data is scaled to real
numbers; the same option controls whether enumerated types (such as
ship type in message 5) are dumped as integer literals or equivalent
string legends.

* A second output-mode option prefixes each field with a field label
followed by an equal sign, for human readability.

* Within the limits of what it does, I believe the decoder is now
production-quality - fast, small, and with a decent test suite.  It
has shipped in gpsd-2.39.

Here is where I'd like to go with it in the future:

* More message types. If you can supply example sentence decodings for
more types, implementation will follow swiftly.  I'm particularly
interested in being able to decode messages containing text 
information, such as safety-related broadcasts.

* Stream-decoding support in GPSD.  This is somewhat tangled up
with the GPSD-NG design issues.  The goal is to allow GPSD clients
to subscribe to real-time reports from an attached AIS transciever
and get them either in CSV form or (via the GPS client library)
decoded into a C structure for convenient processing.

One not-insignificant benefit of the above will be the ability to
rectify the incomplete timestamps in AIVDM messages into full UTC
before clients see them.

What do *you* want a production-quality AIVDM decoder to do?  (A
question for you gpsd-users people as well.)

The direct use of physical force is so poor a solution to the problem of
limited resources that it is commonly employed only by small children and
great nations.		-- David Friedman
