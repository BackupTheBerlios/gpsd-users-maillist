<PRE>The rtcmdecode utility, formerly a filter that turned RTCM2 and RTCM3 
packets into readable text dumps, has been renammed &quot;gpsdecode&quot; and 
now has tha ability to un-armor and text-dump common AIVDM sentences 
as well.

Specifically, it can crack types 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9, and 18.  I'd love
to support others as well but I don't have regression tests for them.
Tip of the hat to Kurt Schwehr of New Hampshire University for
supplying test data and text dumps for these.

The GPSD references page now includes a detailed description of how to
interpret AIDVM, This is significant because public documentation on
this has previously been quite poor.  Many of the relevant standards
are locked up behaind paywalls. Even if they were not, it turns out
that assembling a complete picture of how both layers of the protocol
work (not to mentional regional variants like St. Lawrence Seaway's
AIS extensions like the Coast Guards's PAWSS) is a significant effort.

The gpsd daemon itself does not yet do anything with AIVDM packets,
though the analysis code in its driver is fully working and it could
do anything we want with the data.  I could reduce AIS message types
1, 3, 4, 9, and 18 (everything but 5) to O reports, but I'm far from
sure this would actually be useful.

I think it would make more sense to extend the GPSD protocol so it can
report tagged locations (and associated data) from different sensors
in the vicinity, including both GPSes and AIS receivers.  I'll have
more to say about this in an upcoming request for discussion on the
protocol redesign.

The whole aim of practical politics is to keep the populace alarmed (and
hence clamorous to be led to safety) by menacing it with an endless series
of hobgoblins, all of them imaginary.		-- H.L. Mencken
