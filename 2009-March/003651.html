We have the same situation about RTCM. One gpsd developer (not Eric)
purchased the standards. Eric writes the code and the guy with the
official specs tells Eric if it's correct or not. I assume the gnuais
people are doing the same thing. *Somebody* knows what's in the
standard, and that somebody isn't the one writing the code.

Once we know what's in the AIS message (either because we looked at
gnuais or someone with the official standard is willing to answer
questions), we just turn the write-another-binary-driver crank and out
comes usable data.

&gt;<i> Why is a standard not available in the pubic domain? &#160;This data is requested

</I>&gt;<i> public on their website, we have already paid for it.
</I>
Because PHBs think a standard must be good if it's expensive and must
be crappy if it's free? Because no one is looking at the big picture
and realizing that closed standards are a massive time sink? Because
of some other pseudo-reason that would give me a seizure if I tried
understand it?

GDB has a 'break' feature; why doesn't it have 'fix' too?
