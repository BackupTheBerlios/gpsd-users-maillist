<PRE>Chris Kuethe &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-users">chris.kuethe at gmail.com</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> Because [multiple GPSes connected to one gpsd is] useful.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I occasionally log data from several receivers at the same time. It's
</I>&gt;<i> nice being able to plug in a usb hub with a bunch of receivers hanging
</I>&gt;<i> off of it and then have a single instance of gpsd manage them all.
</I>
Chris is correct.  However, I will note that the original reason I implemented
this capability is that I knew doing it would force me to clean up dodgy
assumptions in the code that would otherwise have remained invisible.  Later
developments confirmed that this was a good decision.

And, in fact, the complexity overhead of this feature is quite low.  It means
there can't be naked global variables expressing session state, but that 
would have been a bad idea anyway.  The main &quot;overhead&quot;, if you want to
call it that, is that all session state has to live in an array of session 
structures in gpsd.c; the rest of the code only &quot;knows&quot; about whetever
individual session structure it's acting on.

In fact, *all* the code support for multisession is in the file
gpsd.c, and there isn't much to it, really.  I don't think this
feature added more than 100 lines to the codebase, all told.
