</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Just be aware that 1Hz update freq is the norm for GPS.  There exist
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; 3/5/10Hz devices, but they are not the norm and you should investigate
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; if you get what you think you are getting...
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; or 100Hz or 250 HZ. These days, if you have the money, they have the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; report frequency.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Are there genuinely devices available with &gt;10Hz update speed?  I
</I>&gt;<i> haven't heard of such a thing?
</I>
Yes. Many are augmented with inertial navigation hardware (INS) often
consisting of gyroscopes and inclinometers. INS devices are very
accurate in the short term. Unfortunately, they drift over time and, of
course, cannot provide absolute locations. Enter the GPS. The better
systems solve all this in a Kahlman filter. Such systems can have a
surprisingly short delay for these calculations (milliseconds).

&gt;<i> &gt; We track a high speed vehicle. In fact, we use the GPS to locate
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; position in real time. Our systems require action when at certain
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; locations (which we may only pass tangentially). We have found that with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a 10 Hz receiver and 38400 baud (and Linux which can have respectable
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; throughput for these sorts of things) the GPS information allows more
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; accuracy/repeatability than the operator pressing a button.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This is somewhat confusing description of your system?  You say you have
</I>&gt;<i> a high speed vehicle and are looking for better accuracy than a human
</I>&gt;<i> pressing a button with less than 1m accuracy?  This seems crazy
</I>&gt;<i> difficult for anything other than a very highly skilled operator to even
</I>&gt;<i> approach?  Surely the computer does better nearly all the time?
</I>
Indeed it does. That is what I was trying to say. Still, don't
underestimate the accuracy of the human. They are pressing the button at
visible locations (e.g., at the start of an intersection). The main
reason we have moved to GPS triggering is that some environments are now
using non-visible or non-drive-past-able trigger points. This is much
more difficult for the human to react to. Human reaction time is in the
order of a couple milliseconds. Some humans can even be trained better
than a monkey in this sort of task :)=

&gt;<i> Also have you looked at devices with higher than 38400 baud? This is
</I>&gt;<i> still quite a lag at 10Hz although I assume that the offset turns out to
</I>&gt;<i> be fixed and can be corrected for?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; in real time at a very high frequency. It also provides data over UDP
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; broadcasts for even less delay.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Sounds interesting, of course my question would be how the processor
</I>&gt;<i> which is transmitting is acquiring the data to transmit?  If it's
</I>&gt;<i> reading it from the GPS at 38400, then sending it over UDP, then all you
</I>&gt;<i> added was a few ms of variable latency to the signal?  You have to be
</I>&gt;<i> sure that you are getting the data actually faster, not just over a
</I>&gt;<i> faster medium...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm sure that I saw some definitions of when various sentences were
</I>&gt;<i> emitted and the implied delays on some GPS spec sheets.  It actually
</I>&gt;<i> sounds like an interesting problem for a (high precision) moving vehicle
</I>&gt;<i> to understand exactly what timestamp a position applies to? (Plus what
</I>&gt;<i> delay from that timestamp you get to hear about it)
</I>
This is one reason we use RS-232 GPS receivers: they have a
pulse-per-second signal that allows greater connection between the
system time and the time in the NMEA stream, which always lags in
arrival. USB GPS receivers need not apply.
