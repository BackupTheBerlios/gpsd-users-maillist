<PRE>Hi

&gt;&gt;<i> Just be aware that 1Hz update freq is the norm for GPS.  There exist
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 3/5/10Hz devices, but they are not the norm and you should investigate
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> if you get what you think you are getting...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> or 100Hz or 250 HZ. These days, if you have the money, they have the
</I>&gt;<i> report frequency.
</I>
Are there genuinely devices available with &gt;10Hz update speed?  I
haven't heard of such a thing?



&gt;<i> We track a high speed vehicle. In fact, we use the GPS to locate
</I>&gt;<i> position in real time. Our systems require action when at certain
</I>&gt;<i> locations (which we may only pass tangentially). We have found that with
</I>&gt;<i> a 10 Hz receiver and 38400 baud (and Linux which can have respectable
</I>&gt;<i> throughput for these sorts of things) the GPS information allows more
</I>&gt;<i> accuracy/repeatability than the operator pressing a button.
</I>
This is somewhat confusing description of your system?  You say you have
a high speed vehicle and are looking for better accuracy than a human
pressing a button with less than 1m accuracy?  This seems crazy
difficult for anything other than a very highly skilled operator to even
approach?  Surely the computer does better nearly all the time?

Also have you looked at devices with higher than 38400 baud? This is
still quite a lag at 10Hz although I assume that the offset turns out to
be fixed and can be corrected for?



&gt;<i> in real time at a very high frequency. It also provides data over UDP
</I>&gt;<i> broadcasts for even less delay.
</I>
Sounds interesting, of course my question would be how the processor
which is transmitting is acquiring the data to transmit?  If it's
reading it from the GPS at 38400, then sending it over UDP, then all you
added was a few ms of variable latency to the signal?  You have to be
sure that you are getting the data actually faster, not just over a
faster medium...

I'm sure that I saw some definitions of when various sentences were
emitted and the implied delays on some GPS spec sheets.  It actually
sounds like an interesting problem for a (high precision) moving vehicle
to understand exactly what timestamp a position applies to? (Plus what
delay from that timestamp you get to hear about it)

Curious

Cheers
