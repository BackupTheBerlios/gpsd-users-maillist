Sounds like a plan. I'll look into that shortly, though if someone
beats me to it...

&gt;<i> Increasingly, the focus of work on this project seems to be shifting

</I>
And this is a good thing. The daemon works, and now people are
learning use it for stuff.

&gt;<i> A third direction is open-source support for flashing GPS firmware.

</I>
Well, I need few things:
 * permission from SiRF to redistribute their firmware blobs (which I
don't have yet). i have very detailed information regarding the
behaviour of the SiRF receivers during programming, so cooking up an
accurate &quot;test bot&quot; shouldn't be a problem. Firmware distribution is
still a problem.
 * a stash of sacrificial hardware to test on. For the benefit of
everyone else, the reason why the gpsflash manpage has all those dire
warnings about turning your receiver into a brick is because I wreck
two of them while mucking about with new firmwares. It's a tricky
thing.
 * documentation for other receiver types. I don't recall seeing
information for other receivers on how to flash the firmware (not that
it doesn't exist). I sold my garmin, so I can't exactly reverse
engineer their protocol. If other people feel like reverse engineering
some protocol or hounding vendor tech support for documentation before
i get around to it, great. Those feeling really brave are encouraged
to have a look at gpsflash and produce the appropriate routines for
non-sirf hardware.

GDB has a 'break' feature; why doesn't it have 'fix' too?
