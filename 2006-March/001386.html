<PRE>gpsd 2.32 is about to ship, incorporating some minor fixes.  There
are still a few known problems with non-SiRF, non-NMEA devices.
But, overall, gpsd has been pretty stable since the 2.30 release
in September 2005.

This is a report on the state of gpsd as I see it, with some
questions about future direction for users and co-developers. 

I consider the architectural work on gpsd itself to be pretty much
done.  The ripples from the big refactoring I did in late 2004 have
died down, and it seems to have paid off handsomely; the new driver
framework is solid enough to support several binary drivers as well as
NMEA dialects.

The autodetection logic for GPS and baud rate also seems to have
worked out well for about 80% of cases, at least since we figured out
how to avoid long startup delays by not changing the initial port
speed unless all the packet-type detectors fail.

I'm aware there are still a few problems in this area, like Axiom
Sandpiper chips getting mistaken for FV18s.  This is why I've paid
a lot of attention to making gpsd buildable with arbitrary subsets
of its drivers disabled; it appears to me that these funny edge cases
mainly come up in embedded deployments and the right solution is to
strip the colliding driver type(s) out of the gpsd build.

I'd take a patch that implemented a compile-time option to lock gpsd
to a fixed baud rate, avoiding autobauding.  Again, this would further
slim down the daemon for embedded deployments.  I'm much more
reluctant to implement a runtime option to fix baud rate, for reasons
already hashed over at length on the dev list.

The test and profiling tools seem to be in good shape.  They've been
stable since the last rewrite of gpsfake.py made it capable of running
test sessions simulatring multiple GPSes feeding a gpsd instance.

I believe multiple-GPS operation is working, but I've only tested it
in artificial situations rather than a real field deployment.  I've
had one report of problems near the F command, but it was
unreproducible, and others with similar use cases reported correct
operation.

* Question for users: Can anyone using gpsd with multiple GPSes for 
production verify that it works?  Are there any known problems?

The PPS-handling code has been disabled for a while because it
seemed to be triggering some sort of bug in pthreads.  I consider
this the most important to-do item.

* Question for Rob Janssen: have you made any progress towards
understanding and working around this problem?

Increasingly, the focus of work on this project seems to be shifting
away from the daemon core.  One direction is clients. The work on C,
Python, and now Perl client libraries has borne the expected fruit; we
now have a rather large assortment of clients, and new ones have
become quite easy to write.

Another direction is DGPSPIP and RTCM-104 support.  Wolfgang Rupprecht 
and I did the heavy lifting on that last year, but the results need
to be polished a bit and tested in real-world deployment.  

* Question for Wolfgang Rupprecht: Wolfgang, if you're listening, where
are those decoder-hardening patches?  And can I get you to put proper
inversion logic in the encoder?

The packet-getter can detect incoming RTCM-104.  Ultimately where I
want to be with this is to be able to hand gpsd any mix of GPS and
RTCM-104 sources and have it do the right thing, allowing clients
to subscribe to either corrected GPS data or DGPS reports. 

* Question for users: Do we have anybody on the user list with a
requirement to work directly with or monitor DGPS correction data?
How important are the RTCM-104 features, anyway?

A third direction is open-source support for flashing GPS firmware.
Chris Kuethe wrote a pre-alpha SiRF flash utility, and I re-factored
it into GPS-type-independent and SiRF-specific pieces glued together
by a driver architecture rather like gpsd's.  As far as I know, this
code has not been tested.  

* Question for Chris Kuethe: Chris, are you listening?  What's our next
step?

Finally, I continue to be impressed by the amount and depth of
expertise that has collected around this project.  We've been gifted
with intelligent, active users and an extremely capable dev team. It's
an honor and a pleasure to be working with you all.
