I understand that the order can't be counted on... but it shouldn't 
discard information it's already received when it gets a different 
sentence with the same timestamp.  That was the logical problem with 
it prior to the patch.

</I>
Well, that's not quite true.  I added a debug-level warning if the 
RMC was received &quot;first&quot;, because that is what the bug was causing it 
to think had happened, when in fact it had not.  All it should do now 
is *not* throw out any information until it receives a new timestamp, 
whatever sentence that comes from (which was clearly the intent, but 
not the operation, of the code before).
