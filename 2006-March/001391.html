Maybe I'm even more confused that I feared. I thought what it did do was
enable a GPS to talk to a program -- which would then do the rest, point
by point, or however each program does do things.

I have two proprietary programs, which will both do what I described --
under W98 or XP -- *almost* usable under linux : the only thing they can't
seem to do is connect to my GPS. 

Under CrossoverOfficePro (CXOPro) 5.0.1, they're installed, they launch,
and once open they seem to do everything else normally -- except connect.

I've been supposing I'd have a choice : EITHER put gpsd between a hardware
port and CXO so that the software would think it's not only running on W98
but connecting to the GPS under W98 (since it would be connecting, under
CXO). OR find a native linux app that would take the place of both CXO and
the proprietary stuff, again using gpsd to talk to the GPS.

Apparently I misunderstood completely what it is that gpsd does. You have
my apologies.
