OK, I can buy that.  If we already know we have a 3D fix then there is
no need to downgrade it from an NMEA sentence that only knows about 2D
fixes with the same timestamp.

That does not solve the problem for ht opposite order going from 2D to
3D every timestamp.

I'll take a look at it.  All I have is Garmin now, so I can not test it,
just look at it.
