<PRE>Steve,
It looks like you are looking for a post processing filter.  Many gis
systems do this.  You may want to look to see if qgis or grass support
this.  The way they work is to determine the delta in area if the
interstitial point is filtered.  

However, if you use my track filter it may not require any post
processing filtering in the first place. And will meet more (if not
all) of your requirements.

Sorry to hear you're working with mysql.  Postgres has an entire GIS
library called postgis.

&gt;<i> I'm going to have to spend more time figuring out distance diffs 
</I>&gt;<i> and how to calculate changes in heading (with the 360 rollover 
</I>&gt;<i> issue) and taking into account speed, etc.  
</I>
What I do is called near-real time track filtering.  
Take last reported position to predict where it would be now based on
time, speed and heading.  Then measure the delta between that and the
current fix.  If it is greater than your threshold then you'll need a
new report.  This will work for what you want.  The challenge is to get
the time, location and tracking values to your liking.

&gt;<i> I may steal some of your algorithms though.  :)
</I>It's under perl license it's very relaxed.

&gt;<i> Currently, I'm working with lat, lon, mph and dir (from the NMEA
</I>&gt;<i> data). 
</I>I would encourage handling all calculations internally as m/s.  Display
MPH only.

&gt;<i> I'd like to get an algorithm that:
</I>&gt;<i> * drops points at the beginning and end of a turn
</I>I assume that &quot;drops&quot; here means &quot;reports&quot; and/or &quot;logs&quot; not &quot;filter&quot;

&gt;<i> * drops points on significant changes in direction
</I>&gt;<i> * drops an icon at the beginning and end of a track and &quot;interesting&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> points, like points where I stood still for &gt; 10 seconds or so
</I>&gt;<i> (traffic light, drive through, ...)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It's difficult to find out what an &quot;interesting&quot; point is and how to 
</I>&gt;<i> calculate it.  Are there other algorithms for trying to devine this
</I>&gt;<i> info 
</I>&gt;<i> that I can look at somewhere that you may know of?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Please let me know if you find any bugs in the GPS::gpsd perl module. 
I'd appreciate any feedback as we are the only two users that I know
off.
Thanks,
Mike (mrdvt92)
