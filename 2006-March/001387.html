<PRE>Prefatory apology : I don't really belong on this list; I hope my question
is not completely off topic.

Last time I looked (probably a year or three ago) there was no hope yet of
connecting my GPS with my computer under linux, for a couple of reasons.
One was my inadequate command of linux: I was afraid even to try commands
like make or install (I can bollix a machine into unusability just doing
root's little jobs), and couldn't even get into gpsdrive, which seemed the
most accessible one.

My nerve grew a little, and I found a very helpful site last week,

<A HREF="http://folk.ntnu.no/gronslet/blog/2005/07/11/gps-software-for-linux/">http://folk.ntnu.no/gronslet/blog/2005/07/11/gps-software-for-linux/</A>

whose owner walked me through it. So I have a linux GPS/map program at
last; but I don't know if it fits my use, or is the best fit.

Also, in process of getting started, I discovered that there are now
several linux GPS/map programs that all use gpsd -- and my command of
linux is still barely up to this first one, or its dumb-user friendliness
down to me, or something.

So I barge in here to ask a Very Dumb Question about comparisons, hoping
it will interest some of you, at least mildly, who actually understand how
there things work. (I took a degree in math once -- but it was pure math,
and nearly half a century ago; then I gave up math and became a
philologist. What I know of cartography, or of hardware, is even less than
I do of linux.)

The scenario is this. My use of a GPS is almost entirely for hunting and
hiking. That means, first off, that I need topographic maps -- and I don't
even know whether those are different, from a programming point of view,
from street or road maps (but I can easily imagine they might be). Also,
the GPS in use is either stationary (I do a lot of sitting near squirrel
den trees.) or in motion only at foot pace -- and not connected to a
computer at the time. (I'm not about to scramble up and down the Blue
Ridge Mountains, far off any trail, with a shotgun in one hand, a laptop
in the other, and a GPS dangling around my neck.)

So what I need is to be able to come home, connect the GPS to a computer
-- where it can't possibly see any satellite -- and then do the map part.

That is, transfer waypoints, tracks, and routes, GPS to computer and
computer to GPS; manipulate them graphically with a real monitor (flat
panel LCD for preference, in case it matters); if at all possible, merge
sets of waypoints without losing any nor creating duplicates; maybe upload
whole topo maps to the GPS; and at times print hard copy.

Gpsdrive, as its name implies and I'm sure you all know better than I, is
intended for use in motion; I haven't been able to tell yet, slogging
through the documentation, whether it will be able to do any of what I
need once I learn to use it -- and on top of everything else, the ISP
carrying its list seems to've blacklisted both my ISPs &lt;sigh&gt;; so I can't
ask there, and probably shouldn't about other apps anyway ....

So I ask here, with apologies : if any of you were going to use a GPS and
a computer in the ways I've just described, which app would you pick? Or
rather, which one would you suggest to a barely computer-literate heavy
user?

All clues gratefully accepted!
