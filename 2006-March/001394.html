</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Well, I need few things:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  * permission from SiRF to redistribute their firmware blobs (which I

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; still a problem.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Talk to &quot;Carl Carter&quot; &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-users">ccarter at sirf.com</A>&gt;.  He's the guy that can get us that

</I>
Yup. It's time for my 6 month re-ping. Last I heard it was still in
legal. I think I'll have to spend some time writing another convincing
proposal explaining why this isn't a bad idea, why it won't compromise
their IP, outlining technical implementation strategies, etc.

Fundamentally this should be no different from a BIOS update: &quot;we ship
motherboards that work. If you flash your motherboard to gain new
features, you void your warranty. If the flash doesn't work, it's not
our problem because you voided the warranty by trying to flash the
BIOS. And even though we allowed you to download a binary blob which
could be interpreted as a BIOS image without cost, it's still our IP.&quot;

I guess it would be acceptable if they were to just distribute a
tarball of the loader and the binary from their website. &quot;We
distribute the driver program, and if you can't get firmware images,
that's not our problem.&quot;

&gt;<i> &gt;  * a stash of sacrificial hardware to test on.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> How many spares do you think you'll need?
</I>
I'd love to say 0, but I think 6 is a reasonable upper bound. Ask me
again after I have my SiRFstar emulator working. Of course, a
development board (with exposed boot control pins) that writes to RAM
(or replaceable flash) would just be the cat's meow.

The two receivers I cooked died while I was using the official SiRF
programmer on a Pharos receiver. So there may be something winky on
the hardware level that we can't know about until it's too late. If
the official SiRF programmer can break receivers, I think it's
understandable that I'm scared of screwing up. :)

&gt;<i> &gt;  * documentation for other receiver types.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Let's solve the SiRF problem first. That covers 80% of the market anyway.
</I>
Sure. We do have a few things on the website anyway, but I should take
an afternoon and do another state-of-the-market survey sometime soon.

GDB has a 'break' feature; why doesn't it have 'fix' too?
