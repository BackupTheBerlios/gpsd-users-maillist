<PRE>Dear Friend.

My name is Barr. David Lugard, A PERSNAL ATTORNEY TO MR BOB GALLAGHER OF 
UNITED STATE OF AMERICA .

I am pleased to inform you about my interest to use your Bank account 
for a deposit of 45.5million with the Bank. It may surprise you,but just 
give me your attention pls.

An AMERICAN mining consultant/contractor with Ghana mining and Natural Resources, made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve 
calendar months,valued at US$45.5million (Fourty Five million five hundred 
thousand Dollars) with the International commercail Bank of Accra Ghana since the year 2000. 
Ever since then,a routine notification has been sent several times to 
him 
without reply.

In 2003, I discovered from his contract employee, the Ghana mining and Natural Resources that my client is dead. 

Unfortunately, was a victim of the AF4590 German Concorde plane that crashed in France.

On further investigation , the entire family was in the plane, and no 
declaretion of inheritance on the deposit made to the Bank, as he 
intend to invest in ASIA.

I have made several research since 2003 till this date, to 
reach any of his relation or family member for claim, without success 
to locate any of them, and the management of the International commercail Bank of Accra Ghana 
PLC is planning to confiscate the fund by the end of this month 
quarter, since the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum for many 
years.

I want you to stand in as the next of Kin to the deceased,for us to 
save the fruits of the old man's labour before it get to the hands of 
some corrupt selfish officials of the government of Ghana,whose interest 
is to confiscate this fund within 14 days from now.

As soon as you consent to this request, I will start the process of the 
neccesary documents to notarize the WILL and obtain the necessary 
documents and letter of probate/administration in your favour 
for the transfer of the fund to your Bank account. 

You will receive; 40% of the total sum as compensation, base on your 
good intention to help me secure the fund in your account. I would also 
like to use 10% of the fund to raise a reputable charity home or 
Foundation in the name of the deceased. My position here as the persnal 
attorney guarantees the successful execution of this transaction.

Looking forward to your urgent anticipation to this offer and pls 
provide me with your full information such as you telephone and fax 
numbers to enable us discuss better.
I WILL LIKE YOU TO REPLY TO MY PRIVATE EMAIL 
ADDRES:(<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-users">llugard2 at netscape.net</A>)

Regards
Barr.David Lugard.
