&gt;<i> Dear Experts,

</I>&gt;<i>   <A HREF="http://www.ocean-server.com/compass.html">http://www.ocean-server.com/compass.html</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It's a small board with a 3-axis accelerometer and a 3-axis magnetic

</I>
Fun. I wish it had gyros too.

&gt;<i> I note that gpsd claims to work with another digital compass from True
</I>&gt;<i> North Technologies; I have the impression that that's a similar device,
</I>&gt;<i> though rather more expensive.  So presumably it will or could be hacked
</I>&gt;<i> to work with my device.
</I>
We only claim weak compatibility with the TrueNorth device. None of
the developers have one and getting access to one seems to be
difficult. There seem to be some quirks with device initialization...

&gt;<i> What I want to do is to get both the compass data AND position
</I>&gt;<i> information from a GPS connected to another USB port.  But as I
</I>&gt;<i> understand it, gpsd does not attempt to merge data from more than one
</I>&gt;<i> source and in fact the application will get one or the other, randomly.
</I>
close. gpsd won't merge data, but it will keep the streams separate.
you can switch between which device you're querying with the F
command.

&gt;<i> Have I understood this correctly?  Is anyone using the True North
</I>&gt;<i> device in combination with a GPS?  Could gpsd be modified to do what I
</I>&gt;<i> want, or am I better off writing my own code?
</I>
I think we had 1 TrueNorth user - haven't heard from him in ages.

i'm not so keen on the current approach to overloading the meaning of
various gpsd internals to map in devices other than GPSes. I think
some refactoring needs to happen if we want to start being a
generalize random-fragments-of-navigation-state relay daemon.

If you're just looking to propagate NMEA data from this compass gpsd
can probably relay it in &quot;R=1&quot; mode, though no processing will be done
- it's just pass-through.

GDB has a 'break' feature; why doesn't it have 'fix' too?
