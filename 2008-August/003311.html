</I>
We try. Yes, development policy, strategy, direction, purpose... is good.

&gt;<i> 3. While I applaud the policy, it is easy to argue about the reasons
</I>&gt;<i> that lead up to it.
</I>&gt;<i> Things like: &quot;99% of&quot; are easily argued about: is that 99% of models?
</I>&gt;<i> Or, 99% of units sold?
</I>&gt;<i> But, I don't really care.  You picked a development target, and are
</I>&gt;<i> writing a good system for that target...
</I>
Practically speaking there is very little difference between &quot;99% of
models&quot; and &quot;99% of units sold&quot;, at least in the consumer space. It's
not really suprising though, considering how thin the margins are in
that market, the chipset vendor usually provides a reference design
and there's probably already an OEM producing modules from that
design.

Within a given chipset family, there seems to be next to no hardware
differentiation. I just bought a Novatel SuperStar II - prices for the
bare board range from about $100 to over $350. It's the same hardware,
just different firmware magic. Globalsat were being jackasses about
sending me an updated firmware to enable WAAS on my BU-353 (hence I'm
boycotting them). I was able to flash the firmware from my TomTom on
to the '353 and got WAAS.

&gt;<i> 4. Question:
</I>&gt;<i> Were these devices, the ones that GPSD is targeting, designed for
</I>&gt;<i> auto-configuration?
</I>
no. and they shouldn't need to be.

we don't really target any particular receiver, rather we want to
support &quot;all of them&quot;. every now and then i find some receiver with
nifty capabilities - I'm particularly interested in more sophisticate
receivers with good timing or static positioning performance - and
this motivates me to work on support for them (cf. itrax03 or ublox).

GPSD, because it's running on such a vastly more capable machine than
the embedded core, should ideally be able to figure out what kind of a
device it's talking to. The developers, being much smarter than a
simple program, should be able to comprehend technical documentation
to figure out whether the device as shipped is well-/poorly-configured
and and whether there's a better output setting. Examples: Trimble
receivers tend to be be configured to output single-precision
solutions, we'd prefer double-precision. Thales/magellan AC12 ships
with all output messages disabled, that's not at all useful. sirf
binary is much more useful than NMEA, but some versions of firmware
emit invalid output packets - gotta avoid those. Certain OEMs ship
with a non-WAAS capable firmware, sometimes the firmware is WAAS
capable but not enabled by default, sometimes the WAAS preference is
for the wrong PRN...

Every receiver has some input commands, some have a richer set than
others. The UT-41 can basically control which sentence mix is being
sent, and what fraction of 1Hz output you get. With an iTrax03 I can
jiggle pretty much every register in the hardware and every tunable in
the software. ublox, trimble, sirf... have varying levels of
configurability.

&gt;<i> 5. Statement: To the best of my recollection,  RS-232/serial/v.24  is an
</I>&gt;<i> evolved, de-facto standard with no inherent support for auto-configuration.
</I>&gt;<i> Since a lot of these devices are serial or treated as such, I'm
</I>&gt;<i> surprised you wend this route.
</I>
Sure, serial isn't designed for autoconfiguration, but it's something
we can do because of the limited search space - known protocols with
distinct signatures and predictable content. It's also something we
should do because the current state of the market sucks frozen dead
bunnies through bent straws - ill-designed protocols, poor default
configuration, firmware bugs... why make the guy who just wants
gpsdrive to work fight with all that?
