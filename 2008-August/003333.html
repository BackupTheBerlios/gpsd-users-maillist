<PRE>Hi Folks--

I've got an et-102/sirfII chipset GPS going with gpsd. I've
used the setup on linuxpps 2.6.26-rc8-pps and freebsd 5.4.
The board is interesting--sirfmon shows SBAS DGPS active here
in California with SV 135 at az 196, el 44. At first I thought
that SV number was a bug in gpsd, 'till I looked up some &quot;SBAS&quot;
/WAAS info on the web.

I had a bit of trouble getting xgps going on my odd old RH (7.1)
setup with xfree86 4.7.0. I had to hack in -lX11 to configure 
in the &quot;checking for XpmCreatePixmapFromXpmImage in -lXpm...&quot;
area so it would try to built it, then I needed to hack
the makefile to add &quot;xgps_LDADD = -lXm -lX11 $(LIBM)...&quot;
so that it would link properly. That got me a working xgps.

One problem I seem to have... The gpsd simply stops delivering
data to any client after an indeterminate time. I've seen this
failure with sirfmon, xgps, and ntpd all failing to get any
data out of gpsd after this happens. With sirfmon and xgps, I
can restart the client and things immediately continue, so I
don't think its the et-102 gps board fubaring. 

I've seen this with gpsd running on both the linux and the
freebsd hosts. 

One time gpsd failed that way, I &quot;HUPped&quot; it and it started
delivering again. &quot;AHA&quot; I thought, &quot;A thighbone club workaround--
crontab the HUP&quot; but then the next time I HUPped, it gave
me a &quot;no such device /dev/ttyS2&quot; and a &quot;bad file descriptor&quot;
error. Sigh.

Another problem I've seen, I can feed dgps into the et-102
via RTCM using the second serial port. The gpsd then does
show the &quot;2&quot; indicating dgps active in the $GPGGA sentence.
However, if I stop feeding dgps into the et-102, the
$GPGGA sentence never drops the &quot;2&quot; back to a &quot;1&quot; to indicate
a reguar (non-RTCM) fix. The chipset spec's 18 seconds as
the default timeout period. I'm not sure if this is a problem
with the et-102 firmware or the gpsd, though.

BTW its pretty cool to see gpsd delivering the pps timestamps
to ntpd via the linuxpps stuff. THX a bunch for all that work!

Now if I can just fix this weird delivery failure issue...
Any suggestions or comments would be welcome.

ps. I also have a Trimble SV6 but the antenna seems to have some
kind of temperature sensitivity in that it fails after warming
up for a few minutes. If I can fix this I'll test it with gpsd.

pps. The et-102 does have the NMEA sentence slop as I mentioned
in another message here, this message is a repost of one that
bounced before (THX for fixing that).
