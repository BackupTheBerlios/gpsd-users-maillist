<PRE>I'm new to GPSD but over the months of May and June I put together a 10
MHz GPS locked reference. It's an HP 10 MHz Oscillator which is
disciplined by a Rockwell Jupiter GPS card. Both purchased on Ebay. The
purpose is to drive test equipment keeping it accurate instead of using
it's internal reference.
 This was built around and with Brook Shera's design. It was an article
in a 1998 QST article. reprints and alot of addons can be found on the
web, just do a search for Brooks Shera.
My plan was also to use the 1 PPS output of Rockwell Jupiter card to
keep time sync. Afterwards I discovered that Rockwell Jupiter card's
accuracy may be questionable, BUT the Brook's design does averaging
which helps to keep the 10 MHz right. This could be divided down to 1
PPS which I'd expect to be very accurate.
Brooks has also developed software to plot accuracy. I'm generally
seeing an accuracy of about 1~4E-11.
Just a thought, 
I'm very interested in finalizing my project with a good output to drive
NTP. 
This project has been around for some time and Hams have added alot of
Bells and Whistles which I've managed to incorporate all that I know of
into my summer hardware project.
If anyone is interested contact me, I have many pictures, notes, and
circuit board design patterns.
