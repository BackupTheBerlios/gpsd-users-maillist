sure it's a hard problem. the fact that we have &quot;-b&quot; is already an
admission of that. it sucks that we have cripple part of gpsd's
functionality (probing the device) because lots of receivers are to
crappy to be able to handle it.

there was some talk of a hybrid approach to configuration. a file full
of protocol commands that could be read in at startup, sort of like
running .login. anything you can type in a shell can go in .login,
anything you could send as a gpsd command could go in the startup
file. this would allow the existing command parser to be reused, and
would promote consistency between startup configuration and runtime
reconfiguration. de-jittering - aka &quot;the J flag&quot; is one example. you
can set de-jittering on a per-connection basis now, but what if you
could set it as a general policy...

&gt;<i> that's a little harsh.  the main argument against command-line
</I>&gt;<i> options in the above links is that they're user-unfriendly.  i'd
</I>&gt;<i> submit that suggesting re-compilation takes that to something of

Yep. I posted that as a &quot;if you really know what you're doing, and
you're absolutely sure you need this fixed configuration, here's a way
to do it.&quot; If you don't like the autoconfiguration, please explain
why. Complaints submitted in triplicate on $100 bills will be given
higher priority, as will those that come with patches.

Extra options are user-unfriendly, and they're contrary to gpsd's main
purpose: to quietly, simply, and reliably mediate transactions between
arbitrary clients and gps receivers. By forcing gpsd into a fixed
configuration, you impair your ability to use more receivers.

I guess I forgot to ask &quot;what problem are you trying to solve?&quot;

-- 
GDB has a 'break' feature; why doesn't it have 'fix' too?
