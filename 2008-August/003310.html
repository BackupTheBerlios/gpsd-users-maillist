By the way, I did want to say a few things on this:
1. Thank you for the pointers
2. I applaud the selection of a software policy as is described in the 
links above.
   Too many pieces of software have *no* development policies or weakly 
defended ones.
   The collection of policies roughly forms the architecture of the system.
   Weak policy &gt; weak architecture &gt; weak code (sometimes colloquially 
known as &quot;spaghetti code&quot;).

3. While I applaud the policy, it is easy to argue about the reasons 
that lead up to it.
Things like: &quot;99% of&quot; are easily argued about: is that 99% of models?  
Or, 99% of units sold?
But, I don't really care.  You picked a development target, and are 
writing a good system for that target...

4. Question:
Were these devices, the ones that GPSD is targeting, designed for 
auto-configuration?

5. Statement: To the best of my recollection,  RS-232/serial/v.24  is an 
evolved, de-facto standard with no inherent support for auto-configuration.
Since a lot of these devices are serial or treated as such, I'm 
surprised you wend this route.
