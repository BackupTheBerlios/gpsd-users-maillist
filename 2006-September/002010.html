<PRE>Hi Gary,

&gt;<i>Actually, I like it so far.  Not as sensitive as some newer GPS but rock
</I>&gt;<i>solid.  Mine is mounted on an antenna mast above my office and gets
</I>&gt;<i>hail, rain, snow, etc. and never missed a beat.  Not like the antarctic
</I>&gt;<i>but still a bit challenging.
</I>
It's good news that you've had a good run with it on the roof. I'm thinking 
about doing the same for my server gear.
I agree that the specs are great - -40 to +85 Celsius. It's not the 
environmental issues that I'm worried about this time - I'm just hoping 
that it doesn't get nuked by static electricity on the I/O lines. Static is 
a real problem in the Antarctic - my experience is that the dry blowing 
snow acts as a giant Van de Graff generator that will kill pretty much 
anything in a plastic box if you're not careful.

&gt;<i>   It doesn't output TTL
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; level RS232 suitable for input straight to a UART - it actually outputs 
</I>&gt;<i> RS232
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; at 5V levels.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Actually, it IS suitable for conenction straight to a UART since those
</I>&gt;<i>run at TTL levels.  It is the RS-232 toi TTL level shifters that get
</I>&gt;<i>you.  I also find that about 2/3 of the time you can connet directly to
</I>&gt;<i>an RS-232 level input and get away with it.  No need for ANY circuitry.
</I>
I disagree here. While the voltage levels are correct TTL, there is an 
inversion required for TxD &amp; RxD to get the sense right. Been there, wasted 
time on it. I can get a screenshot from my CRO if you're interested.


&gt;<i> &gt; Will look at this today. Will let you know how I get on.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>We can always make it a compile time option if it works for you.
</I>
That would be nice. My first cursory glance of the code looks like the 
change is straight forward. Just looking into what the 'state' variable 
holds so I don't tromp on something else.

&gt;<i>You can pay me to go look at it if you want. :-)
</I>
You wish. I didn't get a trip this time - so all the gear had to be able to 
be assembled by an (electronically) untrained field assistant.....

ciao, Dave
