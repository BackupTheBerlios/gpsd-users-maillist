<PRE>Hi Wally,

Thanks for your comments.

I had thought of using another GPIO pin - but didn't want to end up having 
to diverge the GPSD code too far from the norm just to support my app 
unless I had to. Gary Miller has noted (in another post on this thread) 
that I should be able to use RTS for PPS so I'll give that a go.

The Garmin 18 LVC is a funny beast. It's the only one of the Garmin 18 
series that brings the PPS signal out to the connector, but it doesn't have 
true RS232 level signals. Rather, it pushes the RS232 standard boundaries 
by using 0V &amp; 5V levels for mark &amp; space. This doesn't mean that it's 
outputting TTL level RS232 though. The output data is actually RS232 sense 
TTL level data - so you WILL need an inverter to change the sense of the 
datastream before inputting it into a TTL level device such as a UART. I 
still need the level shifter anyway, as the Gumstix outputs are 3.3V, TTL 
sense RS232....

Confused? It took me a little while and some work with the CRO to get it 
all right!


ciao, Dave

Hi, Dave.

Have you considered that there's nothing special about DCD other than
voltage level?  If you have _any_ GPIO pin that can be configured to
generate an interrupt on the rising edge, run it through a ttl&lt;-&gt;232
level shifter and direct the ISR to signal your app.

And if, as the end of your email indicates, you're not committed to a
particular GPS vendor, get yourself a variant that uses ttl signaling
instead of rs-232 (nearly all the OEM gps modules are available this
way) and you don't need the level shifter at all, for either data or
PPS.

 &gt; Hi All,
 &gt;
 &gt; First, some background....
 &gt;
 &gt; I'm attempting to use a Garmin 18 LVC GPS as a time reference on a small
 &gt; datalogger based around the Gumsitx Basix platform.
 &gt;
 &gt; For those that haven't dealt with the Gumstix platform, it's based around
 &gt; the Intel XSCALE PXA255 microcontroller that is also found in a number of
 &gt; PDAs. GPSD 2.33 cross compiles with the Gumstix ARM tools with minimal
 &gt; issues and I have the Garmin 18 and GPSD talking now.
 &gt;
 &gt; The issue is that I want to use the PPS signal from the Garmin to provide a
 &gt; time sync as I've done in the past. No problems - connect it up to DCD on
 &gt; the serial port and all is well.
 &gt;
 &gt; WRONG!
 &gt;
 &gt; The XSCALE processor has four serial ports - but only one of them (the
 &gt; FFUART - Full Function UART) has a full complement of serial port I/O. All
 &gt; the others only have TxD/RxD/RTS/CTS. And the Gumstix designers didn't
 &gt; bring out the FFUART DCD line onto their I/O connector....so I have no
 &gt; access to the DCD line.
 &gt;
 &gt; My question(s)
 &gt; 1. Has anyone else had thoughts about using the RTS line for the PPS
 &gt; signal? I'm not sure if the Linux serial driver would allow it though. If
 &gt; this is thought possible, any pointers to the PPS section(s) in the code
 &gt; would be useful and I'll have a hack at it.
 &gt;
 &gt; 2. Would I be better dropping the the Garmin and going to a SiRF based GPS?
 &gt; I recall a passing mention in my trawling though the mailing lists that
 &gt; using a binary protocol will allow greater time accuracy without using a
 &gt; PPS signal? Is this true or am I confused?
 &gt;
 &gt; 3. Am I completely hosed in trying to get accurate time-keeping without
 &gt; access to a full-function serial port?
 &gt;
 &gt; Any thoughts or pointers would be muchly appreciated.
 &gt;
 &gt;
 &gt; ciao, Dave
