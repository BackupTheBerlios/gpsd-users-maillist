Yo Dave!

If you are serious about the GPS-18/LVC I have been checking on some code
to SVN to use the GPS in Garmin Serial Binary mode.  It is still flakey
so you may want to hold off some more.  There are few advantages to the
binary mode.  One advantage is that the messages are fixed length.  That
means the offset from &quot;real&quot; time to when I decode the PVT message is
pretty stable.  Stable to without maybe +/- 10mS so even without PPS
I can get a fair time stamp from it now.

And a 1/4&quot; socket at the bottom for firm mounting!

</I>&gt;<i> it doesn't get nuked by static electricity on the I/O lines. Static is a real

</I>&gt;<i> plastic box if you're not careful.
</I>
The humidity at my office is often 10% or lower, but not a lot of static
problems here.  I have been at places with static problems and then you
have to be real careful.  My experience with static is that most of the
experts are just wrong.  Things like pink poly, heel straps, and wrist
straps are just useless.  The US Mil-Std is right, the only worksatation
anti-stat measure with a good change of working is an ion-generator
pointed directly at the workspace.

&gt;<i> &gt; Actually, it IS suitable for conenction straight to a UART since those
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; run at TTL levels.  It is the RS-232 toi TTL level shifters that get
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; you.  I also find that about 2/3 of the time you can connet directly to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; an RS-232 level input and get away with it.  No need for ANY circuitry.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I disagree here. While the voltage levels are correct TTL, there is an
</I>&gt;<i> inversion required for TxD &amp; RxD to get the sense right. Been there, wasted
</I>&gt;<i> time on it. I can get a screenshot from my CRO if you're interested.
</I>
Been running mine for almost 2 years, and not an inverter in sight.  Remember
that the RS-232-&gt;TTL level converter is also an inverter.  Since you have
no level converter you need to have your own TTL-TTL inverter.

&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Will look at this today. Will let you know how I get on.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; We can always make it a compile time option if it works for you.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That would be nice. My first cursory glance of the code looks like the change
</I>&gt;<i> is straight forward. Just looking into what the 'state' variable holds so I
</I>&gt;<i> don't tromp on something else.
</I>
Just use it the way that DCD does and you'll be fine.

&gt;<i> &gt; You can pay me to go look at it if you want. :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You wish. I didn't get a trip this time - so all the gear had to be able to be
</I>&gt;<i> assembled by an (electronically) untrained field assistant.....

Life is tough...
