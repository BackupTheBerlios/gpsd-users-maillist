<PRE>
I've now tried some more.  I now really thinks this must be an error
caused by the way gpsd uses the tty layer, garmin_gps uses the tty 
layer, or how the tty layer works on a dual cpu computer.

I've added some debugging statements in my kernel's n_tty.c (the line 
discipline being used by the tty layer when using the garmin_gps serial 
usb driver).

As far as I can see (and please correct me if I'm wrong), the garmin_gps 
driver calls tty_flip_buffer_push (from send_to_tty) for each message it 
receives from the gps.

This causes the tty layer to call the tty discipline's receive_buf 
(either directly from tty_flip_buffer_push, or from a wait queue the 
next scheduling loop).

n_tty_receive_buf will copy the head tty buffer &quot;packet&quot; contents into 
tty-&gt;read_buf and wake up anyone waiting to read from that tty (this can 
be anyone trying to read() from the tty device or anyone doing poll() on 
the device).

The process/thread read()ing from the tty device file will cause 
read_chan in n_tty.c to be called, which uses copy_from_read_buf to copy 
the contents of tty-&gt;read_buf to user space.

I've added a simple printk in n_tty_receive_buf and one in 
copy_from_read_buf.

With these log messages I can see the usb driver writing e.g. 22 bytes 
to the tty layer, followed by a call to copy_from_read_buf returning 
these bytes to the gpsd process.  These are ok, as far as I can see.

But for messages larger than the 64 byte buffer, things behave like this:

	n_tty_receive_buf(64 bytes)
	copy_from_read_buf(64 bytes)
	n_tty_receive_buf(32 bytes)
	n_tty_receive_buf(64 bytes)
	n_tty_receive_buf(22 bytes)
	copy_from_read_buf (repeated several times)

[unfortunately I lost the log files, so the byte counts above may be 
incorrect]

I'm in deep water here, but I cannot see anything stopping the 
garmin_gps driver from calling tty_flip_buffer_push for multiple 
packets, and thus calling n_tty_receive_buf, _before_ copy_from_read_buf 
has returned all of the previous packet (or any of it) back to user space.

Could this possibly be broken since I'm on a dual core cpu?

Unfortunately, I was unable to boot my kernel with nosmp set, and 
booting with maxcpus=1 only made matters worse, where gpsd couldn't even 
probe the GPS properly, since also the small packets got garbled.

Anyone have any insight in this?  I'm obviously in very deep water here...
