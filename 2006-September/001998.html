I just double checked, you are right.  I was thinking of the problems with
Michael (not Mike) was having with his forerunner.

Have Mike (and everyone) try your patch, at least that is another data
point.  If it &quot;works&quot; then we are stuffed badly.

Well that is better than what I thought you meant.  But still a problem.

There are no packet delimieters in the Garmin protocol.  If you view the
garmin data as a stream there is never a way to reliably determine the
start/end of each packet.  That is why when the garmin binary is used
over serial links DLE and ETX packets are used to frame the data.

Without the DLE/ETX and with the packets mashed together you may stay
in sync a while, but any glitch (like restarting id packet) can never
be recovered from.

There are 2 modes to the kernel driver (mode 0 and mode 1).  If the
kernel folks really broke the way the packet mode returns data to
user space then I will have to change the mode that gpsd uses.

It is just not possible to reliably use paceket boundaries when the
packets are mushed together.

&gt;<i> Yes, but you're confusing which parts of the kernel do what here:

I don't really care.  It is all &quot;the kerne;&quot; to me.

&gt;<i> Garmin can only document and implement what's going on between

</I>
I am not talking about Garmin, I am talking about the garmin usb kernel
driver doc.  Which seems to mysteiouslyu disappeared like the test
prgrams that came with the driver.
