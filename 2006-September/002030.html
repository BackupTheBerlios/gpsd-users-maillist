<PRE>Hi,

xgps and kismet seems to be behaving somewhat odd with my Haicom GPS.

xgps says it has a fix every 5 seconds but quickly changes to &quot;no fix&quot; just 
after. Kismet shows similar behavior. GPSDrive, however, doesn't seem to 
behave like this. And the GPS device itself works fine with TomTom on my 
Ipaq.

I've attached a bit of raw output using gpspipe -r if that helps.

I'm using gpsd-2.33.

Regards,
Tais M. Hansen
