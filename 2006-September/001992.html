Mike's problem is not remotely in the least bit like yours.  Your
packets are clearly corrupted.  He is getting good packets.  The packets
that Mike is getting are just not documented, so we need to reverse
engineer a bit.

I guess that is part of my confusion because I see two problems that
have no relation to each other.

A gentoo person that does not update every night?  Wow. :-)

Trying to guess which parts in a read buffer are the real ones and which
are not is madness.  Certainly NOT the way Garmin or the Garmin kernel
driver meant it.  If the kernel driver is returning bytes that are not
part of the packet then the kernel driver is broken.

&gt;<i> I cannot find anything preventing the tty layer to concatenate
</I>&gt;<i> several packets that it receives from garmin_gps into one read buffer.
</I>
Except that the documenetation and implementation of the protocol
specifically require concatentation not to happen.  It is the not
64-byte packets that denote the end of the packet since the packets
themselves have no framing bytes.

&gt;<i> Once this happens, the tty layer cannot know that it should return only
</I>&gt;<i> parts of that buffer to userspace.
</I>
And it never should.  The garin kernel drivers is supposed to return
EXACTLY what the garmin GPS sent, which is &lt;=64 byte chunks.

</I>&gt;<i> Oh, I'm very sorry, for the past emails when I've mentioned Chris, I've

</I>
Mike's packets do not have receive errors. his decode just fine.  There
is no point him trying this.  Mike's problem is that his unit sends the
packet with the satellites, but not the packet with the PVT.  Garmins
are funny that way and a lot is just not docuented.
