If the start and end data (which is out-of-band) is lost, that is
corruption.  Not as bad as bit corruption, but almost as fatal long
term.

</I>
It has magically disapeared from sourceforge.  You need to find and old
copy of the driver and get it from there.

Also, when you look at the tty layer, do you test it with gpsd running?
There are two modes, so I want to verify you are running in the mode that
gpsd uses.

&gt;<i> &gt; The garminusb2nmea is a good one to try, it just does a nice simple
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; dump of the garmin binary and converts to nmea.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, I've tried that one.  It works just fine.  But then again, this
</I>&gt;<i> program doesn't expect to read the same packets from the tty as the gps
</I>&gt;<i> driver receives over usb.
</I>
And I am looking at the garminusb2nmea source code and it is not using
the short packet method to determine the packet framing.  They are also
assuming that a framing error never occurs.

&gt;<i> Let me try to illustrate this again:
</I>
No need, I got it.  It is not the way the protocol was documented nor
implemented.  To do that is just broken.  I will not try to support
such a broken scheme.  Without a way to recover the frame start/end
you can get out of sync and never recover.

IFF the kernel is now so badly broken I will move to the other mode
that does have framing data.  The advantage to that is also that gpsd
would now support garmin binary over serial.
