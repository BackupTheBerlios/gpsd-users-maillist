Ok, I've finally made this work.  I'm not sure if you'll like my 
solution, but here it is anyway!

As I couldn't find anything in the tty layer that could guarantee that 
any two packets passed from the usb layer to the tty layer wouldn't just 
be concatenated into one (unless the client is fast enough reading), I 
went for a different approach.

I decided that the nanosleep in GetPacket() was cause of my problems. 
But while removing it improved my problems, it didn't remove them, and 
it was obviously there for a reason, so I got some problems that weren't 
already there before.

So, here's a patch that will change GetPacket() as follows:

	o replace the nanosleep function with a call to select,
	  waiting up to 1 second   [ This change was enough to make
	  gpsd usable with my gps, but I still got a few errors about
	  packets too long ]
	o before returning, look at the received data, and if we've read
	  more than we need, copy these to a separate buffer
	o at the start of GetPacket, initialize the buffer with the left
	  over bytes from the last run, and only read more bytes if
	  necessary

I've done some testing, and so far not gotten a single error message 
about too long packets.  Maybe Chris could try this patch and see if it 
helps on his system?
