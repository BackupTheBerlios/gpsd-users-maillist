No, the kernel is not corrupting any packets, it's concatenating 
packets.  The packets are not corrupted until gpsd throws away the extra 
bytes read, and then starts reading in the middle of a packet.

I cannot find any dump program with the garmin drivers.  I can see what 
the garmin_gps driver writes to the tty layer by enabling debug in the 
driver though, and it seems to be doing it's stuff just fine.

&gt;<i> The garminusb2nmea is a good one to try, it just does a nice simple
</I>&gt;<i> dump of the garmin binary and converts to nmea.
</I>
Yes, I've tried that one.  It works just fine.  But then again, this 
program doesn't expect to read the same packets from the tty as the gps 
driver receives over usb.


Let me try to illustrate this again:

GPS -&gt; garmin_gps

  64 b SAT data
  32 b SAT data
  64 b PVT data
  12 b PVT data

  22 b Transport data
  64 b SAT data
  ...

(I realize the byte counts may be wrong)


each of these packets are simply pushed up to the tty layer by the 
garmin_gps driver.  When being pushed up to the tty layer, the default 
tty line discipline will copy those data into a single buffer. continuously.

This means that if the reader (gpsd) isn't fast enough with it's reads, 
the 32b SAT data will get concatenated with the 64 b PVT data by the tty 
layer.

This means that the reader (gpsd) will read the following:

64 b SAT data  -- not a short read, so it will nanosleep() and reread
32 b SAT data + 32 b PVT data  -- still not a short read
44 b PVT data  -- a short read, stop reading

gpsd will now recognize the SAT data, but _ignore_ the fact that it has 
read more data than it needs, and just throw the rest of the data away,
thereby completely missing the PVT data.

Now, for the next read, it will read:
  22 b transport data + 44 b SAT data  -- not a short read
  20 b SAT data  -- short read, stop

Again, the transport data will be ok, but the next read will start in 
the middle of the next SAT data, and look corrupted.
