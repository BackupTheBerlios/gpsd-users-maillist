Are you sure about this?  His GPS identifies as the same GPS as mine, 
and his symptoms are very similar to mine, just a bit worse.  I think 
his problems could be explained the same way as mine.

</I>
Well, all parts of the read buffer are _real_ parts, they are just 
concatenated into one.  &quot;Madness&quot; is stretching it a bit I think.
The kernel driver is pushing the data up into the tty layer just fine, 
and just as the garmin protocol directs.  But they are concatenated into 
one part within the tty layer iff the user space program isn't reading 
the data fast enough.

&gt;&gt;<i> I cannot find anything preventing the tty layer to concatenate
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> several packets that it receives from garmin_gps into one read buffer.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Except that the documenetation and implementation of the protocol

</I>&gt;<i> 64-byte packets that denote the end of the packet since the packets

</I>
Yes, but you're confusing which parts of the kernel do what here:

gpsd --&gt; tty layer --&gt; tty line discipline --&gt; garmin_gps --&gt; usb device

Garmin can only document and implement what's going on between 
garmin_gps and usb device.  But what happens in &quot;tty layer&quot; and &quot;tty 
line discipline&quot; is standard linux tty behaviour and is obviously not 
going to change it's behaviour because of a piece of Garmin documentation.

Just to repeat, I think garmin_gps is doing it's job just as it should, 
but the way the tty layer works means that you cannot expect to read the 
raw USB packets from gpsd.

&gt;&gt;<i> Once this happens, the tty layer cannot know that it should return only
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> parts of that buffer to userspace.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> And it never should.  The garin kernel drivers is supposed to return
</I>&gt;<i> EXACTLY what the garmin GPS sent, which is &lt;=64 byte chunks.
</I>
Yes, and it does -- _to_the_tty_layer_.  And gpsd read via the tty 
layer.  And the tty layer doesn't preserve the original packets, but 
concatenates them as it sees fit.

&gt;<i> Mike's packets do not have receive errors. his decode just fine.  There
</I>&gt;<i> is no point him trying this.  Mike's problem is that his unit sends the
</I>&gt;<i> packet with the satellites, but not the packet with the PVT.  Garmins
</I>&gt;<i> are funny that way and a lot is just not docuented.
</I>
Actually, that was my exact symptoms before changing gpsd!

I could read the satellite data just fine, but I was reading the start 
of the PVT data at the same time.  Therefore, when reading the PVT data 
I was already several bytes into the PVT data, and decoding the packet 
was impossible.
