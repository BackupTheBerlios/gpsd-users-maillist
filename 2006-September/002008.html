<PRE>Hi Gary,

 &gt; I'm attempting to use a Garmin 18 LVC GPS as a time reference on a small
 &gt; datalogger based around the Gumsitx Basix platform.

Good so far.  One potential issue.  The LVC is TTL level and not RS-232 level
signals.  Some RS-232 port will not work when driven by the GPS-18/LVC but
most will.

Ahhh - you too have been trapped by the Garmin 18 LVC.  It doesn't output 
TTL level RS232 suitable for input straight to a UART - it actually outputs 
RS232 at 5V levels. The RS232 spec is +3 to +30 (space) &amp; -3 to -30 (mark). 
To connect the 18 LVC to most UARTs (as opposed to a serial port)  you need 
to do any level shifting AND do a logic inversion. For those interested, 
three 2N7000 mosfets and three 10k resistors will do both the level shift 
and the required inversion. Of course, you could also use one of the many 
variants of the MAX232 TTL-RS232 interface IC.

As you note, this 5V RS232 doesn't work on all serial ports - but should 
work on most of the newer ports based around a variant of the MAX232.


 &gt; 1. Has anyone else had thoughts about using the RTS line for the PPS
 &gt; signal? I'm not sure if the Linux serial driver would allow it though. If
 &gt; this is thought possible, any pointers to the PPS section(s) in the code
 &gt; would be useful and I'll have a hack at it.

DCD is no universal for PPS.  Right now the gpsd_ppsmonitor() just uses
an ioctl() to poll the state of the serial lines.  Then checks a mask
(TIOCM_CAR) to see if the DCD changed.  This is in libgpsd_core.c.  It
should be easy to change the mask to poll for another line.

Will look at this today. Will let you know how I get on.

The Garmin PPS spec is +/-1uSec.  You will have a hard time beating that!

Yep, that's why I looked at it. Also, it's an all in one unit which cuts 
down my wiring and antenna feed issues. It's easier to run data long(ish) 
distances than it is to run RF data from a remote antenna. Finally, I know 
they work well - I've currently got one sitting at a field camp on the 
Antarctic Peninsula acting as a Stratum 1 timeserver for a logging system.

Without PPS, depending on who yo ask, you will have a hard time getting
much better than 1 Sec accuracy.  I doubt you could eve get accuracy
past 100mS over the serial line.

That was my original understanding also. Thanks for clearing this up for 
me. Quite often confusion is my normal state of affairs....

Thansk for you advice - it's much appreciated.

ciao, Dave
