<PRE>Hi All,

First, some background....

I'm attempting to use a Garmin 18 LVC GPS as a time reference on a small 
datalogger based around the Gumsitx Basix platform.

For those that haven't dealt with the Gumstix platform, it's based around 
the Intel XSCALE PXA255 microcontroller that is also found in a number of 
PDAs. GPSD 2.33 cross compiles with the Gumstix ARM tools with minimal 
issues and I have the Garmin 18 and GPSD talking now.

The issue is that I want to use the PPS signal from the Garmin to provide a 
time sync as I've done in the past. No problems - connect it up to DCD on 
the serial port and all is well.

WRONG!

The XSCALE processor has four serial ports - but only one of them (the 
FFUART - Full Function UART) has a full complement of serial port I/O. All 
the others only have TxD/RxD/RTS/CTS. And the Gumstix designers didn't 
bring out the FFUART DCD line onto their I/O connector....so I have no 
access to the DCD line.

My question(s)
1. Has anyone else had thoughts about using the RTS line for the PPS 
signal? I'm not sure if the Linux serial driver would allow it though. If 
this is thought possible, any pointers to the PPS section(s) in the code 
would be useful and I'll have a hack at it.

2. Would I be better dropping the the Garmin and going to a SiRF based GPS? 
I recall a passing mention in my trawling though the mailing lists that 
using a binary protocol will allow greater time accuracy without using a 
PPS signal? Is this true or am I confused?

3. Am I completely hosed in trying to get accurate time-keeping without 
access to a full-function serial port?

Any thoughts or pointers would be muchly appreciated.


ciao, Dave
