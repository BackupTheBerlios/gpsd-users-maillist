<PRE>I'm new to this GPS data transfer stuff. 
I hope this isn't a sore subject here...

Why does gpsd not parse more varieties of NMEA sentences?

I hooked up a Humminbird fishfinder with an attached GPS unit which both speak 
NMEA0183. The GPS talks to the fishfinder, which in turn outputs groups of 
sentences in the following sequence, with an &quot;IN&quot; prefix:

DPT (depth)
RMC
DPT
GLL
VTG
MTW (water temperature)
DPT
RMC
DPT
GGA
ZDA
MTW

The RMC, GLL, and GGA sentences all include position information. Parsing all 
of them would quadruple the position update frequency over parsing only GGA 
on this unit. Also, neither gpsd nor gpsbabel can parse the DPT sentences, 
which makes gpsd useful only as a serial port communication tool for my 
application, and renders gpsbabel useless, since it aborts with an error upon 
its first encounter with a DPT sentence.

Of course I can capture the raw NMEA output, but since my intent is to pipe 
this data into a GIS, some parsing and reformatting along the way would be 
quite helpful. The timestamps that gpsd could add, for example, would provide 
valuable position interpolation information for more precisely positioning 
the depth readings between position readings. Boat speed may be as fast as 
10m/s, so not compensating for the delays between depth and position readings 
could misplace the depth readings on the map by as much as 30m.

Ideally, I would have the incoming sentences parsed on arrival at the laptop, 
with position translated from lat-lon to UTM. Then the bathymetry would be 
compensated to MSL elevation using the known water surface elevation, 
compensated for position change, then a point would be added to a vector 
point map in QGIS or GRASS, all in nearly real time. 

See: &lt;gis.esri.com/library/userconf/proc03/p0750.pdf&gt; for an example of this 
type of data collection in Nebraska using proprietary software, although it 
appears that the bulk of the processing was not done on the spot.

Is anyone already doing anything like this with Free software?
