I *think* that for gpsd to use it, the GPS receiver has to be connected
to something that looks to the kernel like a serial port, USB-to-serial
adapter, or similar.  I don't think it can share the serial port with
the &quot;modem&quot; part of the card; it needs to be two separate serial ports.

What you might do is boot up without the card installed, then plug it
in.  Wait a few seconds, then check the output of the 'dmesg' command.
You should probably see some messages about it finding a serial port
and/or modem; possibly it will report a device like /dev/ttyUSB0 ,
/dev/ttyUSB1 , etc.  If it reports a second device with a different
number, that is probably the serial port for the GPS device.  If you
give that serial port to gpsd, gpsd should be able to talk to the
receiver.

If the GPS receiver is accessed in some other way (maybe by AT commands
through the modem port?), then I don't think gpsd can talk to it yet.
