<PRE>&gt;<i> I'm using self compiled gpsd-2.30 on debian testing with a Navilock
</I>&gt;<i> USB Mouse.
</I>
I too have a Navilock USB GPS (the NL-302U). It is a really a re-branded
USGlobalSat BU-353 GPS, ie SiRFstarIII via the PL2303. Cute little
thing.

It works fine in NMEA mode, I have not attempted in any real way to set
Sirf mode, baud rate to othern than 4800, low power mode, etc.
(sirfmon doesn't detect it)

I am using the debian/unstable gpsd-2.28 package back ported to
Debian/stable. (I have made the package available to the DebianGIS
project, it should make it into the Alioth repository at some point,
search the DebianGis mailing list archives if you want a link)
Running on a Mini-ITX VIA CL600 (i586) datalogger.

I was not able to get hot-plug and auto-load via init scripts to work.
Again, I didn't spend too much time trying though.

I found I needed to use -n (the caffeine flag) to get it to work 
reliably.

# gpsd -n /dev/ttyUSB0

 
&gt;<i> I'm having trouble getting a stable gps connection from gpsd 
</I>&gt;<i> to my GPS-mouse
</I>&gt;<i> For debugging I started 
</I>&gt;<i>    gpsd -D 9 /dev/ttyUSB0
</I>&gt;<i> I add some /var/log/messages output. I hope I got the relevant parts.
</I>&gt;<i> After this I start cgps and wait for about 1 Minute. I receive
</I>&gt;<i> acceptable  signals for one Minute and then the connection to the gps
</I>&gt;<i> seems to break.  I have tested this with two Navilock reveivers. They
</I>&gt;<i> both react the same.
</I>
are you sure the gpsd process itself isn't dying as soon as the first
client connects to it? this is what I was seeing.

find out gpsd's PID and watch it in top as you connect a client, or
don't let gpsd daemonize itself and see if it exits to the command
prompt when you connect.



regards,
Hamish
