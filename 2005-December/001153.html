<PRE>&gt;<i> did anyone already play arround with two or more gps receivers to get
</I>&gt;<i> a more  accureate positioning. My Idea is to install more than 2
</I>&gt;<i> gps-receivers on top  of a car to get a more accurate position and
</I>&gt;<i> direction information.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> One Idea is to get an average position of the gps receivers. The
</I>&gt;<i> receivers  will be positioned with a slight offset on the car. This
</I>&gt;<i> would result in  different signal strength and reflections for each
</I>&gt;<i> Receiver. First I could  have a look at the signal strength and
</I>&gt;<i> eliminate the worst signal. Then I  could get an average of all
</I>&gt;<i> receivers with good reception. This way i'd hope  to get a little bit
</I>&gt;<i> more accuracy for my position. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I know it would be better to get the complete internal gps-data from
</I>&gt;<i> the  receivers and make correlations between these signals. But as of
</I>&gt;<i> my  understanding these data won't show up on the normal serial
</I>&gt;<i> connection of a  standard gps mouse.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What do you think of this idea. Is this a completely idiotic?
</I>
It may be that the GPS with the better antenna always wins, or that the
one with the weaker antenna does better calculations.

Better to spend your time/money in other places IMO, unless this is a
critical need. (eg routing the ambulance to the correct side of the
divided highway)

But what the hell, give it a try. GPSD did at one time have support for
multiple devices, I don't know if that code is still active.
