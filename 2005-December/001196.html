<PRE>During some additional testing, I've discovered that 2.28 wasn't as 
reliable as previously reported: seems it works fine with the first 
session, then after disconnecting the first client session, a 
subsequent client connection will cause it to return no data (I'm 
just using &quot;r&quot; on and off for testing here).

Am currently going through prior versions to see where that bug came 
in.  2.25 definitely works, but would be nice not to have to stay 6 
months behind.

[ after testing ]

2.26 exhibits similar behaviour to 2.28 (and I gather the 2.27 
tarball is truncated), so it seems we have a similar problem with 
2.26 and 2.28, and then a  somewhat different and slightly more 
severe version of it in 2.29 and 2.30.

Either way, as far as I can tell, the problem arises when it tries to 
figure out what kind of communication it's getting from the GPS.  In 
2.25 it seems to listen to some stuff, then send off a bunch of NMEA 
strings to the GPS and then start listening to the NMEA stream 
properly.  In 2.29+ it appears to go through the same listening 
process, then send a bunch of NMEA strings to the GPS and then hang. 
2.26/2.28 seem more to listen, then (for the first client) behave 
like 2.25 did, but for subsequent clients just close the GPS device 
and not listen to anything else from the GPS.  I assume, given that 
we're up to 2.30, the aim in debugging will be to fix the bug in 
2.30, so just let me know what else you want me to try!

Cheers,
Robin
