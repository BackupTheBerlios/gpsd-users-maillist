<PRE>Sorry to reply to myself, but I think I found at least the speed problem.

The documentation for gpsd says that velocity is reported in knots. The
Trimble TSIP driver (tsip.c) is not converting the receivers native
format (meters/second) to knots so the speed I am seeing is actually
meters/second.
gps.h defines MPS_TO_KNOTS 1.9437 which is pretty close to &quot;exactly
half&quot; (or exactly double as the case may be) as I described.
I took a quick glance at the specs and source for the SiRF binary driver
and it appears to have the same problem.

I'm still working on the mode problem, but I see where it is. The TSIP
driver is ignoring a few packets where status and mode information is
sent and I imagine my receiver is using one of those packets to transmit
the information. I don't have my receiver handy to test and verify this
at the moment.

Attached is a patch for the speed problem. It's untested as I don't have
the receiver handy but it's not exactly rocket science. Well, I suppose
it is, a bit :)
