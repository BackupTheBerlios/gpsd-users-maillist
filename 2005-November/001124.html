<PRE>I posted a few days ago, but am still struggling with this problem:

I used gpspipe to record gpsd's output for a short trip I took. My 
intent was to be able to &quot;replay&quot; this trip.

gpsfake *seems* easy enough to use, but I am unable to get it to work. 
Each time I try to start it I get:

$ /usr/sbin/gpsfake -b /home/jamoore/start-at-costco.txt
Processing /home/jamoore/start-at-costco.txt...sh: gpsd: command not 
found

Someone replied off-list to my original request, and suggested that the 
cause was due to the fact that /usr/sbin was not in my path as a regular 
user. He suggested I get around the issue by starting gpsfake as root, 
or adding /usr/sbin to the regular user's path.

I actually tried these (and several other tricks) before posting. I 
tried them all again afterwards, but got the same result: gpsfake seems 
to be unable to start (or find?) gpsd.

I am running Fedora Core 3. Ultimately, I want to be able to feed my 
&quot;trip report&quot; to roadmap via gpsd, but obviously need to get past the 
first step.

Can anyone offer ideas, or confirm that the current version of gpsfake 
still works?

Many THanks,
Jay
