You should report what you have tried to save people the trouble of 
telling you what you already know. And how exactly did you try 
adding /usr/sbin to the regular user's path?

&gt;<i> tried them all again afterwards, but got the same result: gpsfake
</I>&gt;<i> seems to be unable to start (or find?) gpsd.
</I>
As root: &quot;which gpsd&quot;. If that is empty, you don't have gpsd. Reinstall 
it.

As user: &quot;locate bin/gpsd&quot;. Should report the same thing. That is the 
path that needs to be added to your $PATH:
$ PATH=/whatever/you/found:$PATH /usr/sbin/gpsfake \
  -b /home/jamoore/start-at-costco.txt

&gt;<i> Can anyone offer ideas, or confirm that the current version of

</I>
First, show us that you've gotten past the shell problems. The error 
posted was not from gpsfake, it was from sh.
