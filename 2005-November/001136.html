History of Navigation:

Back in the day, there was this thing called inertial navigation. It 
worked well enough to send men to the moon and back, put large missiles 
to within a few feet of their target from halfway around the world, and 
other various and sundry tasks. 

The hardware foundation for inertial navigation is instruments such as 
gyroscopes and accelerometers. Their function is to produce electrical 
signals that correspond to changes in the local inertial frame of 
reference. To go along with these instruments - these gyroscopes and 
accelerometers - specialized computing machinery was developed to 
process the raw electrical signals to derive position, velocity and 
acceleration (which are all of course closely related). This computing 
machinery eventually became pretty sophisticated, implementing 
algorithms such as Kalman filtering, for example, to provide 
navigational data with very high accuracy.

GPS is great, but it is certainly not a panacea for navigation. Next 
time you fly in a commercial jet, imagine that your life depends on a 
signal that reaches the aircraft with a signal power level of 
approximately -120 dBm (10**-12 watts), and that it's broadcast from a 
satellite that is in orbit, and at all sorts of risk. System designers 
have, at least in some cases, considered these risks and concluded that 
GPS alone is not enough. In these cases, GPS and the inertial 
instruments work together; they are often said to &quot;aid&quot; each other. And 
this is in fact how it's done in applications where it's important that 
the vehicle not get lost.

So, I would answer your question with a &quot;Yes&quot;.  :)
