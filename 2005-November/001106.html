Sorry, Andy, this is the gpsd-users mailing list, not a vendor of GPS 
hardware. gpsd is software which runs on a Unix-like OS to provide an 
interface to a GPS device.



While we're here ... and off-topic :) ... I have a question for the 
list: recently I got a new (to me) car, and I'm very sad to say that 
something about it (I think the tinting in the glass) has made my 
handheld GPS unit unusable. :( It's a Garmin Geko 201[1], tiny thing, 
no jack for an external antenna.

Most of my use for the thing (let's be honest, it's a toy!) is in the 
automobile, and I cannot justify spending more money on it. So now it's 
a toy that's not much fun. :(

I suppose I could tape a plastic bag to the exterior of the car and run 
the cable through the door or window, but then the unit's controls and 
display will not be accessible and I'd be wholly dependent upon the 
laptop's display. Also, the length of the interface cable might be 
another problem.

Any suggestions for a workaround which would not entail breaking glass 
or cutting metal would be appreciated. If anyone in North America is 
interested in a swap for something which would take an external 
antenna, please write offlist (rob@ my domain is best, but a reply to 
this case-sensitive address will work too.)



[1] The Geko is a nice unit for a handheld, small but with decent 
capabilities including WAAS. The interface cable, which is sold 
separately, has both a power (cigarette lighter plug) and a DB-9 serial 
connection. Check it out at garmin.com if you're interested.
