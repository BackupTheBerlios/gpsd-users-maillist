<PRE>Hello Matt,

Thanks a lot for your quick response.

&gt;<i> I wonder if the laptop is turning off the USB devices to save power,
</I>
Yes, I believe it's turning off the power since my optical 
USB mouse is also powered off when the lid is closed.

&gt;<i> and the USB-to-serial device (or even the eTrex) is getting confused.
</I>
No, they do not get confused. See below.

&gt;<i> To check: Don't run gpsd at all, but instead launch minicom or a
</I>&gt;<i> similar terminal emulator.  Point minicom at the serial port of your
</I>&gt;<i> GPS device, adjust bit rate, parity, etc, and you should see the NMEA
</I>&gt;<i> sentences coming in. 
</I>
Good point, works. I even can simply run &quot;cat /dev/ttyUSB0&quot;
to see the NMEA sentences.

If the lid is closed and opened again after some seconds, 
all my applications do continue to work, expect the &quot;cat&quot;
command. I observed it with strace during lid close/open:

write(1, &quot;37&quot;, 2)                       = 2
read(3, &quot;\r\n&quot;, 4096)                   = 2
write(1, &quot;\r\n&quot;, 2)                     = 2
read(3, 0x1001a000, 4096)               

But if i press ctrl-c to abort the &quot;cat&quot; and
run it again it continues to deliver data.
Therefore I do not think that the Garmin nor the USB to serial dongle 
are confused. 

But your are totally right, it's not a problem of gpsd.
Thanks for pointing this out.
But I think gpsd probably could work around the problem
and reopen the device if no data is coming in for some time.
But this is probably the totally wrong approach.

&gt;<i> dongle or kernel drivers are getting confused; you might look at the
</I>&gt;<i> output of dmesg for clues.
</I>
Yes, that looks indeed interesting, after resuming my mouse,
keyboard etc get initialized  but the usb2serial dongle is missing:

It even mentiones &quot;pl2303 1-1:1.0: no resume for driver pl2303?&quot; 
so it's definitely a problem of the usb 2 serial driver.

I tried to work around the problem by sending a SIGSTOP to
minicom before sleeping and a SIGCONT after resuming but
no luck. Unfortunately I can't just rmmod and at resume insmod 
the driver again without having to stop gpsd and viking.

I guess I have to look for a kernel patch for pl2303.c
or a new usb 2 serial adaptor whose kernel driver supports suspend.

Thanks a lot for pointing me into the right direction.


Cheers, Lixus



&gt;<i> You should be able to get a little newer than 2.30; have you tried
</I>&gt;<i> downloading the tarball of 2.37 and compiling that?
</I>
I now succedded to compile laest svn trunk but I had to disable
d-bus but I guess d-bus is not related to my suspend problems, is it ?
