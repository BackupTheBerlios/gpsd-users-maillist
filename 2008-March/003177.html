<PRE>Hello,

 

We've run into a little issue with v2.37.  When disconnecting the
satellite signal from our system (using our code), gpsd still reports
that we have a fix status, though properly with no updates.  It has been
confirmed that in previous versions (like v2.33) this was not the case.
We would get a &quot;NO_FIX&quot; status.  We also tested this out with cgps and
saw the same issue with no fix status change on disconnect.

 

Is there an option that was added to v2.37 to maintain this FIX even
when the signal is disconnected or could this be a bug?

 

PS: Also would like to know why we're seeing 20+ satellites (with our
code as well as cgps) when we know there should only be about 5 to 8
visible at any given time.  Are we being reported the FULL constellation
of satellites and not just the ones in view?

 

Thanks,

Gino
