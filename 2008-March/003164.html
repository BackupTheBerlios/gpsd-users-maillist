<PRE>Hello List,

I am using gpsd 2.30-1ubuntu3 together with viking for real time tracking.
I have a Garmin eTrex connected to an USB2Serial dongle and I am using NMEA.
That all works fine but if I close the lid of my Laptop it is suspending
to RAM to save battery power. If I wake it up again, gpsd hangs and therefore also viking hangs:

This his what happens if i suspend/resume and watching gpsd with strace:

read(7, &quot;&quot;, 370)                        = 0
write(2, &quot;gpsd: closing GPS=/dev/ttyUSB0 (&quot;..., 35) = 35
ioctl(7, TCGETS, 0x7fcbc308)            = -1 EIO (Input/output error)
ioctl(7, TCGETS, 0x7fcbc344)            = -1 EIO (Input/output error)
ioctl(7, TCSETS, {B4800 -opost -isig -icanon -echo ...}) = -1 EIO (Input/output error)
close(7)                                = 0
select(1024, [3 6], NULL, NULL, {1, 0}) = 0 (Timeout)
select(1024, [3 6], NULL, NULL, {1, 0}) = 0 (Timeout)
select(1024, [3 6], NULL, NULL, {1, 0}) = 0 (Timeout)
select(1024, [3 6], NULL, NULL, {1, 0}) = 0 (Timeout)
select(1024, [3 6], NULL, NULL, {1, 0}) = 0 (Timeout)
select(1024, [3 6], NULL, NULL, {1, 0}) = 0 (Timeout)
select(1024, [3 6], NULL, NULL, {1, 0} &lt;unfinished ...&gt;
Process 1412 detached

This is what I see when running gpsd in debugmode in foreground
while suspend and resume:

gpsd: &lt;= GPS: $GPGSV,3,3,11,22,27,056,00,28,24,303,00,32,64,071,00*46

gpsd: can't use GGA/GGL time until after ZDA or RMC has supplied a year.

Is this a bug, and if yes is that is already fixed ?

I would love to test against newest gpsd but unfortunately
gpsd from svn does not compile on my ubuntu dapper 6.06.

Thanks, Lixus
