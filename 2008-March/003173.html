<PRE>Hi,

I'm in the midst of sourcing all the hardware to build an in-dash car
system to put in my car including DVD, MP3, GPS, access to the car's
ECU, etc.  The last piece of hardware I'm missing is a GPS receiver
and antenna.  I'm curious if someone down here can suggest a good GPS
receiver to buy to put in the car.  It does not have to have (and I
would prefer if it didn't) any display, just the GPS receiver box, and
an antenna that can connect to a computer preferably via PCMCIA or
USB, but serial is acceptable (bluetooth doesn't work; the laptop I
have for this purpose doesn't have it).

I checked the hardware page on the gpsd webpage, but most of the
receivers listed as 'excellent' were dead links or the site they went
to made no reference of the product listed as 'excellent'.

I just need a cheap GPS receiver and antenna I can interact with using
a linux box and some mapping software to perform the functionality one
would expect from a regular gps unit (mapping and figuring out where
the hell I'm going.)

Also, if it helps any, I'm  in Canada, so products that're locally
available are preferred, but not necessary.  The only (obvious)
requirement is that it behaves well with gpsd.

Any suggestions are appreciated.

Thanks,
Justin

</PRE>
