<PRE>Hi all,

Adding my story to the page of compatible GPS-es.
1. Geonaute Keymaze 300
2. Worked with 2.33 but no longer
3. <A HREF="http://www.geonaute.com/EN/keymaze-300-19389541/">http://www.geonaute.com/EN/keymaze-300-19389541/</A>
4. GPS: SiRFstar III. USB-to-serial: PL2303 (lsusb ID: 067b:2303)
5. USB
6. Decathlon stores / Geonaute brand
7. Started with gpsd 2.33 shipped with Ubuntu 7.10.
   Device was reported as Generic NMEA, and worked fine
   (GPS mouse mode has to be activated on the receiver)
   Then I learned that there are more functionalities available in
   later versions of gpsd, (I wanted the J data refreshing policy),
   and I found gpsd 2.34 in gutsy-backports, and upgraded to that.
   Device was now reported as SiRF binary, and thus the J policy was
   no longer needed. The GPS mouse mode was still operating fine,
   BUT the user level software of the device has no longer contact
   with the GPS chip. That is the satellite display is totally empty
   and there is no fix. (and navigating the device menu slowed down
   terribly)
   I figured that the new gpsd probably switched it to SiRF binary
   mode and the device's software only speaks NMEA and can't even
   switch it back. So I googled for switching it back and I tried
   various menu items in the &quot;SirfDemo&quot; Windows program.
   It never showed any recognizable output from the receiver, and
   afterwards even the remaining GPS-mouse functionality was lost
   even back in Ubuntu. Now sirfmon says:
<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-users">root at spectre</A>:/home/marcingo# sirfmon /dev/gps0 
Hunting at speed 9600, 8N1
Hunting at speed 4800, 8N1
Hunting at speed 9600, 8N1
Hunting at speed 19200, 8N1
Hunting at speed 38400, 8N1
Hunting at speed 57600, 8N1
Hunting at speed 57600, 7N2
Hunting at speed 4800, 7N2
Hunting at speed 9600, 7N2
Hunting at speed 19200, 7N2
Hunting at speed 38400, 7N2
Hunting at speed 57600, 7N2
Can't sync up with device!

   I downloaded the latest firmware from their website and flashed
   it. It worked and now even the navigation of the menu is back
   to normal speed, but as far as GPS receiver, it is still useless.

8. NMEA version: don't know and now can't determine.
9. I liked the device, it is wrist wearable, very small and lightweight.
   15 hrs claimed operation with the internal battery is true.
   Pretty cheap.
   Drawbacks: small memory: only 250 points per track, only 7 tracks,
   and no elevation/speed/etc. data is saved in the trackpoints, only
   lat/lon. Can't upload data ONTO the device at all, only save your
   tracks and flagged waypoints. Maybe too cheap.

Insert this information in the compatibility table please.
A week ago I would have said compatibility to be Excellent,
but now I say USE the -b flag! (which is unfortunately not present yet
in Ubuntu's gpsd 2.34) before it is too late.

Any wild last straw suggestion to revive the device is welcome.
I'll take it back to the store as it is pretty new, but they can
probably dismiss me with 'Linux is not supported'.

Marton
