<PRE>Thanks for your response Chris.
I have one concern here. In my case, the GPS device has to be controlled by an application designed by me as the communication with it is based on proprietary protocol which GPSD cannot understand. For my application to start GPS device and requesting it for location fix, a trigger has to be provided by GPSD. Else my application has to try connecting to GPSD and upon success, start the device and issue a request. But if GPSD and my application, both start at boot-up, then my application upon connecting to GPSD, would  start GPS device which ideally shouldn't have happened till an external application (map application like xGPS) requests for location fix as this would consumes precious battery power.
Can you please comment on the same? Please let me know if the trigger is provided by any other interface of GPSD.

Thanks &amp; Regards,
Praneet Kumar A.

&gt;<i> Hello Team,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm new to GPSD and need some basic information to get myself started. Can you please answer the following questions?
</I>&gt;<i>  &#183;  For establishing connection, what does GPSD expects from lower layers (some host s/w)  if it is configured to read data directly from a socket port? Will it act as a server which keeps listening to a socket port waiting for lower layers to connect to it or is it the other way around?
</I>
the protocol is documented in the manpage. (<A HREF="http://gpsd.berlios.de/gpsd.html">http://gpsd.berlios.de/gpsd.html</A>)

gpsd listens on a tcp port (default 2947) and relays data to connected sockets.

&gt;<i> &#183;  How does GPSD intimate/communicate the/with lower layers (some host s/w) to provide it with NMEA data? I need this information for initialising my host s/w and feeding the data to the socket when GPSD comes and waits on it.
</I>
it doesn't initiate communication with software. it waits for software
to connect. if your software needs to communicate with gpsd, you will
have to attempt to connect, and handle connection failure.

&gt;<i> &#183; When and how would GPSD starts execution? Does this execute when some client application starts and request for location data or does it start at system start-up and run in background?
</I>
It starts up however you start it up. Some people start it at boot
time, some people run it by hand, some applications look for gpsd and
try to start it...

&gt;<i> Please provide me with GPSD's basic flow and its interface information.
