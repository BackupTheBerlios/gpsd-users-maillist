</I>
Ok, let's see if I can be less confusing...  All of the above is
with the hotplug stuff starting gpsd when I plug in the device, or
after I've killed it (with the device still plugged in) and
restarted it manually.  The former apparently doesn't get the right
privs, or maybe it drops privs too soon.  Whatever the case, any
clients get no data.

So udev/hotplug/gpsd all work correctly, except for the no data
part...

In the latter case, if I start it manually as root, the data seems
to flow fine for the first client (eg, xgps), and others can connect
to the socket while the first client is still running, but if I
close the first client to connect, it goes dead and I have to
restart gpsd.

This one I think is because gpsd always seems to start probing at
9600 when a client connects, but then it falls back to 4800 before
it actually connects with the gps device itself (and only the first
time is successful).  The second time a client connects (after the
initial client exits) it probes at 9600 and freezes.  So it looks
like that USB/serial widget doesn't like being probed again at 9600
once it's already been initialized the first time at 4800.  Just a
guess...  Killing gpsd and restarting/connecting makes it happy.

&gt;<i> &gt; I have myself in the tty group, and the device is created
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; correctly:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Having yourself in the tty group is not necessary.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; crw-rw----  1 root tty 188, 0 May 22 22:25 /dev/tts/USB0
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; lrwxrwxrwx  1 root root 8 May 22 21:12 /dev/ttyUSB0 -&gt; tts/USB0
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It doesn't seem to matter whether I start it with the usb script
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; or a real init script, the thing always runs as user/group
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; nobody/tty.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So I assume the issue is my lack of the proper group setup, but
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'm not sure how to go about it...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It would be sufficient to cause a problem if you're not launching
</I>&gt;<i> gpsd as root.
</I>
If I start it automatically via hotplug, it should be starting as
root (but doesn't work).  I made a gentoo init script (sort of a
cross between the ntpd and kismet scripts) which should also start
as root, and even when I run it manually (as root) it still doesn't
work...

I'm not sure what else to try.

&gt;<i> I also see that the the /dev/ttyUSB0 link is created with owning
</I>&gt;<i> group root when it needs to be group tty.  How is it actually
</I>&gt;<i> being made? Are you using the hotplug scripts in the gpsd
</I>&gt;<i> distribution?
</I>
The way I understand it, the link perms don't matter; it's only the
actual device that has the controlling permissions.  In any case,
the link and device are created by udev when the gps unit is plugged
in (actually the USB/serial converter, a PL2303).  Since my udev
rule sets the group (tty) and mode (0660) I don't think I can do
anything about how the link is created.

Anyway, thanks for the answers (and the Python fix).

Steve

PS. I lent the device to a fellow Gentoo-dev for a couple of days;
I'm sure she'll have some updates to my ebuild...

&gt;<i> &gt; 2) gpsprof barfs with a TypeError with Python 2.3, and I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; couldn't see anywhere that specified a particular version.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Still working on this -- can't try to reproduce it yet as my test
</I>&gt;<i> device is stubbornly refusing to get a fix.
