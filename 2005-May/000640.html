<PRE>Tobias Hebel &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-users">thebel at uni-koblenz.de</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> &gt; So please tell me
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; what about the following is not clear:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think, the only problem is, that I don't know, where gpsd's internal 
</I>&gt;<i> device list is and how I can alter it.
</I>&gt;<i> If I understand the manpage correctly, I can start gpsd with two 
</I>&gt;<i> recievers plugged in and can use both of them, when they are listed in 
</I>&gt;<i> the internal device list.
</I>&gt;<i> Only, if I want to alter this list during runtime, I need this control 
</I>&gt;<i> socket thing with &quot;-F&quot;...?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thinks that made it uneasy to understand the manpage are:
</I>&gt;<i> 1. You use &quot;f&quot; and &quot;F&quot; for the same thing, though &quot;f&quot; and &quot;F&quot; have 
</I>&gt;<i> different meanings in other circomstances of the program.
</I>&gt;<i> 2. What is a control socket?
</I>
Is this better?

&lt;para&gt;Internally, the daemon maintains a device list holding the
pathnames of GPSes known to the daemon. At any given time, each client
will be listening to only one of these.  By default, a client's device
is the one that most recently shipped information to the daemon at the
time the client first requests GPS information (that is, issues any
comand other than F, K, W=0 or R=0).&lt;/para&gt;

&lt;varlistentry&gt;
&lt;term&gt;f&lt;/term&gt;
&lt;listitem&gt;&lt;para&gt;Gets or sets the active GPS device name. The bare
command 'f' requests a response containing 'F=' followed by the name
of the active GPS device.  The other form of the command is 'f=', in
which case all following printable characters up to but not including
the next CR/LF are interpreted as the name of a trial GPS device. If
the trial device is in &lt;application&gt;gpsd&lt;/application&gt;'s device list,
it is opened and read to see if a GPS can be found there.  If it can,
the trial device becomes the active device for this client.&lt;/para&gt;

&lt;para&gt;The 'f=' command may fail if the specified device name is not on
the daemon's device list.  This device list is initialized with the
path given in the -f command-line option, if that was specified.  For
security reasons, ordinary clients cannot change this device list;
instead, this must be done via the daemon's local control socket
declared with the -F option.&lt;/para&gt;

&lt;para&gt;Once an 'f=' command succeeds, the client is tied to the
specified device until the client disconnects.&lt;/para&gt;

&lt;para&gt;Whether the command is 'f' or 'f=' or not, and whether it succeeds
or not, the response always lists the name of the client's device.&lt;/para&gt;

&lt;para&gt;(At protocol level 1, the F command failed if more than one
client was attached, and multiple devices were not supported.)&lt;/para&gt;
&lt;/listitem&gt;
&lt;/varlistentry&gt;

&lt;para&gt;&lt;application&gt;gpsd&lt;/application&gt; maintains an internal list of
GPS devices.  If you specify an -f option, the list is initialized
with that pathname as its only member; otherwuse the list starts
empty.  Commands to add and remove GPS device paths from the daemon's
device list must be written to a local Unix-domain socket which will
be accessible only to programs running as root.  This control socket
will be located wherever the -F option specifies it.&lt;/para&gt;

&lt;para&gt;To point &lt;application&gt;gpsd&lt;/application&gt; at a device that may be
a GPS, write to the control socket a plus sign ('+') followed by the
device name followed by LF or CR-LF.  Thus, to point the daemon at
&lt;filename&gt;/dev/foo&lt;/filename&gt;. send &quot;+/dev/foo\n&quot;.  To tell the daemon
that a device has been disconnected and is no longer available, send a
minus sign ('-') followed by the device name followed by LF or
CR-LF. Thus, to remove &lt;filename&gt;/dev/foo&lt;/filename&gt; from the search
list. send &quot;-/dev/foo\n&quot;. Your client may await a response, which
will be a line beginning with either &quot;OK&quot; or &quot;ERROR&quot;.  An ERROR reponse
to an add command means the device did not emit data recognizable as
GPS packets; an ERROR response to a remove command means the specified
device was not in &lt;application&gt;gpsd&lt;/application&gt;'s device list,&lt;/para&gt;
