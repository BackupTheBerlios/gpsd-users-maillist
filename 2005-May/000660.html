<PRE>Hello all,

Thought I'd drop in and say thanks, gpsd has really helped me out quite
a lot. Several years ago I developed a line a products that used a GPS
on an 8 bit CPU. All programming was done bare metal, from the TCP/IP
stack to interpreting the return from the GPS. A great deal of that code
I wrote (certainly not all of it).

In the last year I was lucky enough to be asked to port the application
to Linux. I went from more then 30k lines of C code to sub 10k. Mostly
because the OS takes over much of the lower level communications
functions, but some of that savings was also because of gpsd. It allowed
me to quit parsing NEMA stream info and just ask for what data I want.

So thanks for the great app.

Now on to the feature request. Most of what I've done in the last 6
months was done on X86 systems that have an on-board RTC clock and had
fairly easy connection to the Internet so I could run ntp-date and set
the PC's clock on startup daily. Since gpsd appears to use the on board
clock for the year that worked well. 

Well now I'm working with a Gumstix and it does not have a RTC so it has
no idea of time from a cold boot. Once the GPS locks the time/date is
correct except for the year. Somewhat of a problem. Sometimes I've been
able to run ntp-date but not always, some networks I'm working from are
very restricted and I can't connect via ntp-date to set the time/date of
the gumstix.

Here is the request. Add a flag to gpsd that will if started as root
once the GPS gets lock set the time/date of the PC. Then go to normal
GPSD operations getting the year from the system clock.

Is this possible or do I need to request raw data and process the nema
data so I can set the date myself?

TIA,

David
