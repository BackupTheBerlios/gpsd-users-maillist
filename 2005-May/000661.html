<PRE>David I S Mandala &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-users">davidm at them.com</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> So thanks for the great app.
</I>
You're welcome!  Parsing NMEA is exactly what gpsd is intended to free
you from having to do.
 
&gt;<i> Here is the request. Add a flag to gpsd that will if started as root
</I>&gt;<i> once the GPS gets lock set the time/date of the PC. Then go to normal
</I>&gt;<i> GPSD operations getting the year from the system clock.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Is this possible or do I need to request raw data and process the nema
</I>&gt;<i> data so I can set the date myself?
</I>
For the last couple of releases, gpsd has dropped root privileges
before it processes input from *anywhere*, and long before it gets a
fix.  That way, we don't have to worry about gpsd being used as a
vehicle for privilege-escalation attacks.

So what you're asking would be possible, but only by breaking a
security property of the program that I consider important.  

If there were some way to get a persistent handle on the clock-setting
capability while root and hold it past the point of privilege-dropping,
my objection would go away.  But I think we're talking about an 
oridinary privileged system call here.

Seems to me, though, that you could get the same effect from a
special-purpose gpsd client with root privileges.  Start your gpsd,
start the client, have it connect up and spin waiting for a fix from
gpsd, then when it gets one it can set the clock and terminate.

I'd guess you could do this in sixty lines of code *with* comments,
about two hours' work start to finish.
