<PRE>Tobias Hebel &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-users">thebel at uni-koblenz.de</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> I read the man pages, but I don't understand them. What is meant by control 
</I>&gt;<i> socket? How do I use the -F command? What is the difference between -f and 
</I>&gt;<i> -F?
</I>&gt;<i> How do u use the f command in the telnet session?
</I>&gt;<i> Please explain, perhaps in german!
</I>
I don't speak German.  I would prefer to solve this problem by improving the 
manual pages so I never have to give this explanation again.  So please tell me
what about the following is not clear:

&lt;varlistentry&gt;
&lt;term&gt;-f&lt;/term&gt;
&lt;listitem&gt;
&lt;para&gt;Set a GPS device name.&lt;/para&gt;
&lt;/listitem&gt;
&lt;/varlistentry&gt;
&lt;varlistentry&gt;
&lt;term&gt;-F&lt;/term&gt;
&lt;listitem&gt;
&lt;para&gt;Create a control socket for device addition and removal commands.&lt;/para&gt;
&lt;/listitem&gt;
&lt;/varlistentry&gt;

&lt;para&gt;At any given time, each client will be listening to only one of
the GPSes known to the daemon.  By default, a client's device is the
one that most recently shipped information to the daemon at the time
the client first requests GPS information (that is, issues any comand
other than F, K, W=0 or R=0).&lt;/para&gt;

&lt;varlistentry&gt;
&lt;term&gt;f&lt;/term&gt;
&lt;listitem&gt;&lt;para&gt;Gets or sets the active GPS device name. The bare
command 'f' requests a response containing 'f=' followed by the name
of the active GPS device.  The command may be followed by an '=', in
which case all following printable characters up to but not including
the next CR/LF are interpreted as the name of a trial GPS device. If
the trial device is in &lt;application&gt;gpsd&lt;/application&gt;'s device list,
it is opened and read to see if a GPS can be found there.  If it can,
the trial device becomes the active device for this client.&lt;/para&gt;

&lt;para&gt;The 'F=' command may fail if the specified device name is not on the
daemon's internal search list.  This search list is initialized with
the path given in the -f command-line
option, if that was specified.  For security reasons, ordinary clients
cannot change this search list; instead, this must be done via the
daemon's local control socket declared with the -F option.&lt;/para&gt;

&lt;para&gt;Once an 'F=' command succeeds, the client is tied to the
specified device until the client disconnects.&lt;/para&gt;

&lt;para&gt;Whether the command is 'F' or 'F=' or not, and whether it succeeds
or not, the response always lists the name of the client's device.&lt;/para&gt;

&lt;para&gt;(At protocol level 1, the F command failed if more than one
client was attached, and multiple devices were not supported.)&lt;/para&gt;
&lt;/listitem&gt;
&lt;/varlistentry&gt;

&lt;para&gt;The commands to add and remove GPS device paths from the
daemon's internal search list cannot be sent over the socket from a
client.  Instead, they must be written to a local Unix-domain socket
which will be accessible only to programs running as root.  This
control socket will be located wherever the -F option specifies it; if
that option was not given at startup, &lt;application&gt;gpsd&lt;/application&gt;
is restricted to monitoring its default device.&lt;/para&gt;

&lt;para&gt;To point &lt;application&gt;gpsd&lt;/application&gt; at a device that may be
a GPS, write to the control socket a plus sign ('+') followed by the
device name followed by LF or CR-LF.  Thus, to point the daemon at
&lt;filename&gt;/dev/foo&lt;/filename&gt;. send &quot;+/dev/foo\n&quot;.  To tell the daemon
that a device has been disconnected and is no longer available, send a
minus sign ('-') followed by the device name followed by LF or
CR-LF. Thus, to remove &lt;filename&gt;/dev/foo&lt;/filename&gt; from the search
list. send &quot;-/dev/foo\n&quot;. Your client may await a response, which
will be a line beginning with either &quot;OK&quot; or &quot;ERROR&quot;.  An ERROR reponse
to an add command means the device did not emit data recognizable as
GPS packets; an ERROR response to a remove command means the specified
device was not in &lt;application&gt;gpsd&lt;/application&gt;'s device list,&lt;/para&gt;
