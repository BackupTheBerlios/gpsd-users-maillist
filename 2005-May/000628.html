<PRE>Hi all,

I've just tried updating to a significantly newer version of gpsd, 
but so far my upgrading efforts have been rather unsuccessful.

I've successfully downloaded, compiled and installed gpsd-2.23 (from 
source .tar.gz - on Mac OS X, so no RPMing) - exactly as I had done 
gpsd-2.6 (which worked perfectly)... but now it just doesn't want to 
talk.

The command I *used* to use to start gpsd (version 2.6) was:

/usr/sbin/gpsd -p /dev/cu.usbserial0

However, I understand the new gpsd is supposed to be much cleverer, 
and not to need anything like that in the command line.  So, I've 
tried running it using the same command line, and also without the 
&quot;-p /dev...&quot; arguments, but completely without success.  When run 
without &quot;-p ...&quot;, it responds to the f command with &quot;F=?&quot;.  When run 
*with* that (or using &quot;-f /dev/cu.usbserial0&quot;), it simply hangs on 
the first command sent to it (no response... although it doesn't drop 
the connection).  Having been unable to reproduce the bug in 2.7 when 
run through gdb, although that might just have been bad luck (since 
it is highly intermittent in when it occurs), it's looking more and 
more like I'm stuck with 2.6 as the last &quot;working&quot; version.  Anyone 
got any hints on how to get 2.23 working from source rather than RPM? 
Also, if anyone could explain how we're supposed to use a &quot;control 
socket&quot;, that would be great - I assume that's something for which 
you have to write a program using the connect() function, but it 
seems ridiculous that there's no way other than writing, compiling 
and executing a whole separate program to start gpsd and then 
configure it in a working manner... so... umm... help? :)

Cheers,
Robin
