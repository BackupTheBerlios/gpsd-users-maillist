<PRE>As usual, shipping 2.24 triggered a flurry of patches and contributions.
Rob Janssen sent in some good Zodiac fixes.  Tobias Hebel bugged me
about unclear language on the gpsd man page, stimulating a rewrite of
a couple of sections.  The revised pages are already up on the website.

Tobias also nudged me for a feature that Rob Janssen had previously
suggested and I'd been considering myself -- the ability to specify
multiple devices to be probed at startup with gpsd command arguments.
That is now implemented, tested, and documented.  The -f switch is now
a no-op kept solely for backward compatibility; the man page warns
tthat it may be removed in a future version.

Current bugs and unexplained phenomena:

Remco, using a SiRF chip at level 231, is still seeing a 10-second
offset in his reported GPS times.  Rob Janssen and I, with the same
hardware, aren't seeing this.

Wallace E. Owen &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-users">owen at titan.com</A>&gt; and Rainer Scholz &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-users">ras at sigos.de</A>&gt;,
who may or may not be different people :-), have reported that after
gpsd has been running for a long time (5 hours in Rainer's original
report) something clobbers the device name and zeros it out.  Rainer
seems to have established that this is due to some change introduced
between 2.21 and 2.22; I've sent him a diff which we're going to try
to whittle down until we can figure out what.

Roeland Th. Jansen &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-users">roeland at linux-it.nl</A>&gt; was reporting no data from
a BU-303.  I have a BU-303 and it's working fine.  I don't know if
he has checked out SVN head recently.

Rob Janssen (I think) is reporting that control socket creation
isn't working for him.

The NTP interface:

There's a messy question about how NTP shared-memory segments should
be associated with GPSes.  At the moment, the code allocates just
one and all devices report through it.  It would be better for each
device to have its own segment, so they look like separate time
sources to NTP and it can apply its heuristics for weeding out
the less consistent ones.  

The trouble with this is that:

1) The default build of NTP only supports 4 segments.  Thus, if we
allocate them per GPS device, we're not unlikely to run out of them.

2) We may actually want *two* segments per device, one for message time
and one for PPS time.

3) We can't grab new segments after privileges are dropped.

I think we're going to be stuck with grabbing pointers to all four
segments just in case gpsd wants them, and then having control-socket
commands to bind NTP unit numbers to devices.

Thread-callback support:

I'm still looking at Alfredo's patch.  I haven't merged it because
I don't understand it yet.
