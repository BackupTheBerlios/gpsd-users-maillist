</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
I don't think I can without going back to parsing NEMA data, by itself
GPSD outputs the wrong date if the system clock is not set to the
correct time. Or am I missing something and there is a way to get the
correct time out of GPSD when the system clock is not set?

&gt;<i> I'd guess you could do this in sixty lines of code *with* comments,
</I>&gt;<i> about two hours' work start to finish.
</I>

I don't mind the time coding, in fact I'd happily give the code back to
the GPSD project, I just don't see how to get the necessary info from
GPSD.

Cheers,

David
