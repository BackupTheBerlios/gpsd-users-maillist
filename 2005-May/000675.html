<PRE>The bug list is, except for Roland Th. Jansen's report of a BU-303 not
returning data, empty (my BU-303 still works fine).  The GPGSV parse
bug that has occasionally been clobbering device names has been
squashed in an inelegant way; I intend to pursue it and cure the
disease rather than just short-stopping the symptom.

Now that we have privilege-dropping, multi-device support, D-BUS
broadcasting, thread-callback support and a C++ wrapper class, I don't
know of any feature requests with more urgency behind them than &quot;yeah,
that would be nice someday&quot;.

Question for Rob Janssen: now that we have PPS support, is reducing 
serial-message jitter still important? The to-do item about changing
the FIFO threshold has been sitting there for a long time. I think
you're the only person with the motivation to do it and the know-how
to test the results.

Another question for Rob Janssen: if a device has an ntpshm segment
attached to it, and the device is removed, what should happen?  Does
the answer change if there is another device active with no attached
segment?

But this stuff is just polishing.  If there's anything else any of
you think actually still *needs* doing, I'd like to hear about it.

We shall not cease from exploration, and the end of all our exploring will be
to arrive where we started and know the place for the first time.
