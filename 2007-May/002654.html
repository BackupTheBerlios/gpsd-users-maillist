<PRE>I've done some experimenting,  and it appears that the Deluo can be made 
to work with 2.34 (and,  probably,  other recent releases).  I haven't 
done enough testing to &quot;certify&quot; it,  but I've had no problems in 
several sessions totalling a few hours of actual runtime,  where it was 
failing essentially every time in my first configuration.

I upgraded the kernel from 2.4.26 (which is known to have some PL2303 
driver problems) to 2.4.34.  There are very limited reports suggesting 
that some problems were fixed somewhere around 2.4.30,  and my 
experience so far is consistent with that.

The other software change I made was to build a gpsd with all (I think) 
proprietary protocols removed,  because I suspected that probing for 
them was causing problems in the Deluo's firmware.  Specifically,  I 
used (all on one line,  of course):

./configure --disable-python --enable-shared=no --disable-sirf
    --disable-tsip --disable-fv18 --disable-tripmate --disable-earthmate
    --disable-evermore --disable-garmin --disable-evermore --disable-tnt
     --disable-itrax --disable-italk

Most people will probably not want to include the &quot;--disable-python&quot;.  I 
did that because I'm running gpsd on some stripped-down installations on 
limited hardware.  The &quot;--enable-shared=no&quot; shouldn't have affected the 
problem,  but I needed it so I could run different 2.34 setups 
side-by-side.

My recommendation is that an &quot;NMEA-only&quot; runtime option be added,  so 
that users who aren't sophisticated enough to build their own gpsd from 
scratch can make use of the Deluo (and possibly other) GPSes that 
misbehave when probed for non-NMEA protocols  I've read the 
philosophical objections already raised by the developers to such 
changes,  and agree with the principle,  but I believe the 
&quot;show-stopper&quot; nature of the problem,  if it affects &quot;enough&quot; users,  
would justify an exception to the rule.
