Uh-oh.  If the Linux kernel automatically opens it as a console at
boot time, I don't think gpsd will be able to use it.

If you can convince the kernel not to open the console port at boot
time, you might be able to plug your GPS into that port, and then telnet
or SSH in over one of the Ethernet ports.

Finally, if this

is the critter you're dealing with, it looks like the avr32 chip on it
has got three serial ports, but only one of them (USART1) is brought out
to a DB-9 connector.  The other two (USART0 and USART2) go to the J5 and
J6 expansion headers.  If the supplied driver knows how to talk to
USART0 and USART2, you could get more serial ports.  You'd have to
connect a MAX232 (or equal) chip and a DB-9 connector to the pins on J5
and J6

The gpsfake script supplied with gpsd is designed to do precisely this.
You give it a text file full of NMEA sentences or binary packets from
your GPS (which maybe you captured on your desktop PC or whatever), and
it launches an instance of gpsd and feeds the file into gpsd.  gpsd
thinks it's talking to a real GPS on the serial port.

I kinda sorta remember that you don't have Python on your board, though,
and gpsfake is a Python script.  You could build Python on the desktop
and install it on the board.  :)

You might be able to do the same thing that gpsfake does &quot;manually&quot;.
gpsfake uses a psuedo-terminal to make gpsd think it's talking to a
real serial port.  A psuedo-terminal is basically two entries in /dev
that are magically connected to one another; stuff written into one
comes out of the other, and vice versa.  man 7 pty on your friendly
local Linux system to learn more.  You would need to write an
application in an available language on your board that prints out NMEA
sentences or binary packets on the standard output, say my-gps-fake.
Then you'd do something approximately like...

$ gpsd /dev/ttyp0
$ ./my-gps-fake &gt;/dev/ptyp0
$ telnet localhost 2947

There are probably some niceties of setting up the psuedo-terminal that
your application might have to do.  Take a look at gpsfake.py to see the
whole story.
