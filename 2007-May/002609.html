I've stopped marking devices as &quot;excellent&quot; ... it's either &quot;good&quot; or not.

Good (good enough) means that there are likely to be drivers, we can
easily parse the protocol and get useful data to you.  Less than good
means that we have to do stupid tricks to get the receiver into a
useful state, or the data is often erroneous, there are build quality
problems, non-portable kernel modules may be needed, ...

&gt;<i> I'm looking into buying a cheap(ish) bluetooth/USB (no serial on my
</I>&gt;<i> laptop) GPS unit and it must work in linux, as I don't have windows.
</I>
I'm not terribly fond of bluetooth.
1) yet another device spraying in the 2.4GHz ISM band
2) yet another device sucking batteries
3) many bluetooth devices are buggy and don't respond well to serial
speed changes
4) bluetooth is still needlessly complicated.

also, I don't run linux or have any bluetooth adapters. I haven't got
around to hacking in usb support to my bluetooth-only GP-821.

Your receiver have a prolific or ftdi controller - a silicon labs or
USB ACM controller may be acceptable, though silicon laboratories
don't release programming documentation, so open source drivers for
this chipset may be buggy (works on my trimble and itrax though).

You should be able to avoid needing crazy kernel modules (like those
required for some magellan or garmin receivers)

Your recevier should have a reasonably well documented chipset - SiRF,
Trimble, ANTARIS, Garmin are pretty good. iTrax may also be acceptable
- I've got a working useful iTalk decoder, but there are some gaps in
their documentation.

Depending on your usage, you may need a higher sensitivity receiver.
SiRF3 does a pretty good job of locking on to a signal, at the cost of
some accuracy. In a side-by-side of (sirf2, sirf3, itrax3, lassen-iq)
test in an urban canyon, only the sirf3 and itrax3 got signal, but
there was a lot more randomness in the sirf3 solutions. The logs from
the itrax were also fairly noisy, but they were a lot closer to the
path I walked.

Find some candidate receivers, and then ask one of us (probably me)
what I think.

GDB has a 'break' feature; why doesn't it have 'fix' too?
