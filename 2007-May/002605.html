I can think of two ways.

The &quot;quick&quot; way is to let gpsd initialize the TackTick/GPS combination,
and then have your code tell gpsd &quot;r1&quot; to get the raw sentences.  Then
it's up to your code to parse the $IIMWV and $IIVWR sentences that gpsd
doesn't understand.  I _think_ that you can do this and still use gpsd's
'o' command to get a nice parsed version of the GPS information that
gpsd does understand.  This is not the Right Thing (tm) to do (see
<A HREF="http://gpsd.berlios.de/faq.html#why_not_parse_nmea">http://gpsd.berlios.de/faq.html#why_not_parse_nmea</A> ) but can probably be
implemented relatively quickly if you know how to code.

The &quot;correct&quot; way is to add parsing for the MWV and VWR sentences to
gpsd, and then either add a gpsd protocol command or add fields to an
existing command (probably 'o') so your code can get the new information
about wind speed and direction.  There is a little discussion about this
at <A HREF="http://gpsd.berlios.de/hacking.html#designahead">http://gpsd.berlios.de/hacking.html#designahead</A> .  This is a little
more complicated to code, but more importantly requires some gpsd
implementation decisions to be made.  That's not a bad thing in and of
itself, but the process is not totally under your control... you have to
get a bunch of hackers to agree on something.  :)

In either case, there is one thing you can do that will help: log some
$IIMWV and $IIVWR messages for test purposes.  Probably the simplest way
to do this is to hook up minicom (or equal) as was previously discussed,
tell it to log to a file, and let it rip for a while.  Preferably, while
the logging is happening, you would also sail around, or drive around,
or twirl the weather vane and anemometer cups yourself to provide some
variation in the data.  Once you have some test data in a file, you (or
anyone else you give the file to) can use the gpsfake command to feed
the data in the file into gpsd, as if the data was actually coming from
the TackTick/GPS combination.  This lets you debug your code without
having to go sailing again.  (On the other hand, perhaps going sailing
is a feature.  &quot;Sorry, honey, I have to go debug some code again.&quot; *)

* I work with a bunch of mechanical engineers and I keep trying to
convince them that we need to investigate the effect of salt-water
corrosion on thin-wall aluminum cylinders in the presence of organic
solvents.  I think they like the idea but feel that the boss is smart
enough to decode that and turn down the funding request to go drink
beer on the beach.
