Aside from a couple of receivers that are known to emit garbage for
NMEA, pretty much anything that speaks NMEA will work. We prefer
binary protocols with single-packet PVT solutions, of course.

Have a look at <A HREF="http://isuite.fastrax.fi/">http://isuite.fastrax.fi/</A> - there are some pretty
obvious gaps in the documentation, but the protocol decoders for PVT
and SV info work. No fancy mode control or configuration yet. :P Thus,
anything from Fastrax will have the same level of support, no matter
what hardware they're running isuite on.

&gt;<i> Sure wish we could find a vendor who sells GPS
</I>&gt;<i> units of whose guts we are certain so that we
</I>&gt;<i> may buy with confidence!
</I>
The way you do that is organize a group buy, round up a few hundred
thousand dollars, and call the nice folks at some vendor and say
&quot;here's a big box of money, build us receivers that don't suck.&quot; It's
all about money - some days prolific controllers are cheaper, some
days the FTDI is. For some applications the Sony/SiRF/uNav chip has
the right price-performance mix. Or buy from a vendor who's not so
concerned with price and is more concerned with a stable
bill-of-materials. This is why we try break the hardware list down the
way we do.

&gt;<i> I don't care about Bluetooth or not, if someone
</I>&gt;<i> made a 5.6GHz interface that is fine as well.
</I>&gt;<i> It is the absence of cables that is valuable -
</I>&gt;<i> and Linux compatibility!
</I>
Linux compatibility is also impeded by vendors who aren't terribly
cooperative about documentation or firmware licensing. And by the
crude toolset.

You've obviously never been to a security conference with wireless
net. Absence of cables is a not a guaranteed win. What if I start
flooding the ISM band with noise ... I can DoS your entire rig. With
cables, I can at least have a little more confidence in my data
integrity. For automotive uses, I guess you can make the case that
wireless is a win.

GDB has a 'break' feature; why doesn't it have 'fix' too?
