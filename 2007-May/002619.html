Getting agreement from me will be difficult. I don't see a clean way
of extending the O message to handle these quantities. Our attempt at
mapping the truenorth compass into our standard PVT format is ugly to
say the least.

I'd argue that {wind,water} direction, velocity, temperature, pressure
have no place in a navigation solution. They are utterly irrelevant to
the position of the navigation set (or the phase center of its
antenna). They are, relevant in the larger context of describing the
environment when the plane crashed or the ship sank, but I consider
mixing enviromental measurements and navigation solutions to be
pollution.

*If* gpsd is to begin forwarding arbitrary NMEA messages, or parsing
them, I think that would best be handled by a protocol v4 message. I
say &quot;If&quot; because I'm unconvinced that we want to get into the business
of parsing non-gps data. If we did go that way, it would be good to
have a copy of the NMEA spec.

Finally, I'm worried about the stability of the state machine; It's
somewhat frightening how much noise looks like a valid protocol
message, at least for a few characters. I've seen instances where a
bunch of noise was mistake for NMEA because it happened to have $GP in
it...

&gt;<i> In either case, there is one thing you can do that will help: log some
</I>&gt;<i> $IIMWV and $IIVWR messages for test purposes.  Probably the simplest way
</I>&gt;<i> to do this is to hook up minicom (or equal) as was previously discussed,
</I>&gt;<i> tell it to log to a file, and let it rip for a while.  Preferably, while
</I>&gt;<i> the logging is happening, you would also sail around, or drive around,
</I>&gt;<i> or twirl the weather vane and anemometer cups yourself to provide some
</I>&gt;<i> variation in the data.
</I>
You'll want a static, known file, and a moving file. There may be
things that show up when moving that don't show up at rest.

For a quick hack, have a look at how I added support for !AI___
passthrough. I'm not convinced I made the right decision, but it's
fairly simple.

GDB has a 'break' feature; why doesn't it have 'fix' too?
