<PRE>In late March I was able to add gpsd to the list of projects checked by
by the Coverity defect scanner.   This is a serious static-analysis tool
that is notoriously good at spotting buffer overruns and similar
problems.  It has been used on the Linux kernel to good effect.

I have just spent an hour or so looking at our defect report and
applying appropriate fixes.

I am very pleased to be able to report that for 22,793 LOC, the 
Coverity scanner printed exactly four (4) problem warnings.  Of
these, 

* One was an obvious false positive readily preventable with
  an assert() describing a precondition. (Now fixed.)

* One is a subtle false positive that I'm going to have to learn 
  Coverity annotations to suppress.

* Two are genuine but very minor bugs. One is in rtcm.c and one in
  libgps.c -- neither is in the daemon code. (Both now fixed.) 
  It is rather unlikely either bug has ever been evoked.

That's an actual defect rate of less than 1 in 11,000 lines, which
is almost ridiculously low for a project of this size and complexity
and qualifies the code as not merely bulletproof but armor-plated
like an Iowa-class battleship.

I think all contributors to this project should feel extremely proud
of this result.  

I also think we owe some thanks to the splint project, which built the
first static analyzer I ran on this code.
