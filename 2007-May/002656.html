<PRE>HI
i have prepared a general FAQ for  NMEA.
Can you please verify the answers?
also i am not able to find answer to 2 questions that i placed at the end..9 and 10.
and here it is


1. does the Gps device send information(message) on request(from the Application)?
 Or the Gps device is always pumping messages to the receiver.

The GPS almost always outputs data gratuitously. Under rare
circumstances you may have to poll things from the receiver, or engage
in some bi-directional protocol. But that's very rare. And you'll know
when such things are needed...

2. As far as i got to know, type of messages and their sequence is vendor dependent 
and there is no fix protocol to be followed. Nmea 0183 talks about a lot of messages 
and each vendor selects a few from that list. Is this correct?

The exact output order (as far as we can tell) is non-standard. There
are a handful of sentences that make sense and are a good idea for a
receiver to output. These are generally implemented by all vendors.
Other sentence types (namely VTG and ZDA) are not as heavily used -
these types are often either not enabled by default or are totally
unimplemented in the receiver's firmware.

3. is there any ack of the command?

the ack of the command is vendor specific..
in case of GARMIN
a). if there are no errors in the sentance it will be echoed upon receipt. if an error
is detected, the echoed PGRMI sentence contains the current defualt value. 
b). all configuration changes take effect after receipt of a valid value except baud 
rate. baud rate changes takes place on the next powercycle or an extrenal reset.
in case of FASTRAX
the command is acknowledged by the device by echo of the smae command along with the 
checksum added to it. 
.......................
Depends. Some receivers just do what you ask of them or fail silently,
other receivers send an explicit message. SiRF -&gt; $Ack (OK), uBlox -&gt;
$PUBX (error message), Fastrax -&gt; $PERR (error code)

If there are any specific acknowledgements required, those would be
documented in the device's hardware and/or binary protocol manual.
Garmin seems to make the only devices that need a handshake. Most
other receivers tend to happily spew out navigation data whether or
not anyone is listening.


4. what is the meaning of Data valid / data not valid field.
&quot;if for some reaosn the fix cant be calculated eg not enough visible satellite
only the GSv message are sent in non synchronous mode. in synchronous output mode, 
all non masked messages are sent once per second, regardless if a valid fix is 
available or not.&quot;
the device has this information that the current fix is a valid fix or not. so it
informs the receiver accordingly.

5. what is UTC time stamp of the fix?
i think that there exists saperate clock in the gps receiver which it tries to synch 
with that of the satellites. and when gps device clock is synchonised then it behaves 
just as an atomic clock. the fix produced by the gps device has time stamp named as 
utc.

6. all commands are specific to maufacturer?
there exist no standard commands. all the commands to these gps devices are manufacturer 
specific just communicating efficiently their own hardware.

7. NMEA sentences are complete or fragmented?
tyhe sentences are complete in the sense that each sentence has its standard start and 
end sequence. but may be that a single sentence does not contain the complete ifnromation.
for example in GPGSV message the complete information is fragmented in parts.

8. are there different logical channels for data and contol commnads?
i think logically at least two channels are there one is for commands and other for data.

9. why there is redundancy of information gll and gga both tell the position fix?   


10. if we palce some wrong configuraton data, what is the behaviour of the device..?

waiting for your comments and suggestions..
regards
ravi
