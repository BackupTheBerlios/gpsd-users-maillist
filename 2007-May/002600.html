If the PCI card acts like a normal RS-232 or USB-to-RS232 serial port
to the system, then gpsd should be able to talk to it.  However, I
Googled and it's not clear that the available GPS PCI cards work this
way - they talk about drivers for various operating systems, which
often means it's some weird interface.

Depending on your requirements, you may be able to _make_ one.  The
first way I can think of is to buy a GPS module and wire it to a PCI
serial port card.  At a previous job, we used Furuno GPS modules that
were only about 10 mm x 30 mm x 60 mm.  They had a coaxial connector
for the antenna input, and another connector for power, ground, and
5V (TTL) serial port.  It would be pretty easy to mechanically attach
one of these to a PCI serial port card.  Electrically, the power would
come from the PCI bus, the module's serial port would be connected to
the card's serial port (probably through a level shifter such as a
MAX232 chip or equal), and the module's antenna connector could be
mounted on the card bracket.  This does require soldering and
mechanical assembly, but I think it is highly likely to work.

The second way would be to buy a CompactFlash GPS card - two are
listed at <A HREF="http://gpsd.berlios.de/hardware.html">http://gpsd.berlios.de/hardware.html</A> .  Then buy a CF to
PCMCIA/PC Card adapter, and a PCI card with a PCMCIA slot.  Plug the
CF GPS card into the adapter, and plug the adapter into the PCMCIA
slot.  This adds a layer of software - there has to be a driver for
the system to recognize the PCMCIA interface on the PCI card - but
should not require any soldering.
