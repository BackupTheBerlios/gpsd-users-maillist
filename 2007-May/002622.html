That leads the fundamental question of whether Gpsd exists to provide a
x,y,z,t GPS navigation solution or a general NMEA parsing solution. If
it exists to provide solely a navigation solution, with NMEA as one of
many accepted input flavors, then so be it. But if it claims to be NMEA
parsing software, it needs to recognize that NMEA was designed with all
these inputs in mind, fed from a ship's instruments to its bridge over a
crude network, using a common language. Not just LORAN-C or GPS
positioning info- that just proved to be the most popular use. And of
course lest-we-forget, the M in NMEA is for Marine...


FWIW....

Both water depth and temperature are longstanding navigational aids.
Perhaps more of historical use, but water depth, given some local
knowledge, will answer the am I on/off the continental shelf &amp; how close
to shore am I question, and water temperature may be used to test, for
example, where you are in relation to the gulf stream. They are hard
reality-check positional data that's difficult to argue with and as such
was probably more critical to safe navigation than the sextant was.
(and yes, still used today even on ships with all the fancy electronics)

Most, if not all, industrial use depth sounders will include a
thermistor in the pinger package (helps with the speed of sound calc),
and will retransmit both depth &amp; temperature as NMEA to be integrated
with the navigational displays on the ship's bridge. Just about every
marine navigation software package out there will look for that data and
display it if found*. Any package sold with recreational or racing
sailboats in mind, or to assist large ships to dock, will likely pass
through any wind &amp; current info it can find. Most will interface with
autopilot messages as well, e.g. non-GPS generated NMEA from B&amp;G
hardware  <A HREF="http://www.bandg.com">http://www.bandg.com</A>

They parse NMEA for depth &amp; ping return strength (sea floor hardness),
and I see at the bottom of the page it now can incorporate COG, SOG,
GPS-compass (antenna array) heading, currents, etc. They are certainly
a major potential user of Gpsd if not using it already.


For our use, we log the physical properties of the sea as the ship is
underway as a method of monitoring, in real time, where we are in
relation to ocean fronts. In addition this is archived and post-
processed to provide context for any samples taken under way.
Having to parse raw NMEA ourselves is a PITA, given that Gpsd is already
running.


&gt;<i> *If* gpsd is to begin forwarding arbitrary NMEA messages, or parsing
</I>&gt;<i> them, I think that would best be handled by a protocol v4 message. I
</I>&gt;<i> say &quot;If&quot; because I'm unconvinced that we want to get into the business
</I>&gt;<i> of parsing non-gps data. If we did go that way, it would be good to
</I>&gt;<i> have a copy of the NMEA spec.
</I>
Complying with the NMEA standard is one thing. Even if we did that 100%
it is likely that many manufacturers wouldn't, and we still have the
practical problem of unexpected junk coming down the line. 
(see also HTML standards)


All in all, it would sure be nice if gpsd had some sort of sanitized
plugin mechanism for allowing users to graft on support for custom
messages. We (as VARs/developers/tinkerers) can continue to randomly
hack in support for the non-GPS messages we need, but it would be a lot
nicer and much more more robust to be able to do this in some prescribed
way with checksums and sanity checks already taken care of. Sure we can
use raw mode, but then you lose all the NMEA parsing goodness.

It is surely a huge time-sink and bad idea for Gpsd to try and
officially support/include every new message type that comes along, but
if Gpsd could provide the tools to users to do that themselves, then
everyone wins.
