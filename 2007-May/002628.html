ldconfig looks for shared libraries in some &quot;standard&quot; directories
(like /lib and /usr/lib) plus some user-specified directories (like
maybe /usr/local/lib).  It sets up the symbolic links to the latest
version of the library, and also stores some information in a cache
file (usually /etc/ld.so.cache ).  When you run a program, the loader
(ld.so) uses the symbolic links and cache created by ldconfig to load
the correct libraries for the program you're trying to run.  ld.so
doesn't have to spend time digging through all of the library
directories; it basically says &quot;I need libfoo.so.3 so I'll look it up
in the cache - OK, the cache says it lives in /usr/lib - I'll open
/usr/lib/libfoo.so.3 (which is really a symbolic link to
/usr/lib/libfoo.so.3.1.4 but I don't know that) - OK, this looks like
a shared library, I'll get what I need out of it.&quot;

The upshot of all of the above is that it only really makes sense to run
ldconfig on the target system.  Running the x86 ldconfig on your desktop
machine would update the information for the x86 loader, but wouldn't do
anything for the avr loader.  If you have an ldconfig for avr at all,
it'll most likely only be on your target system.  (The other way to do
this would be to have an avr emulator and a copy of your target
environment on your desktop machine.  That way the avr ldconfig could
run under emulation and set up everything it needs to.  You'd then need
to copy the *entire* environment from your desktop to the embedded
system to get things to run.)

&gt;<i> 2) when i take the resulting gpsd executable to my avr32 system and
</I>&gt;<i>    attempt to run it, i get &quot;can't load library 'libstdc++.so.6'.
</I>
Running ldconfig on the target system *might* fix this.  Or, perhaps C++
support wasn't selected when you installed Linux onto the embedded system -
you might have to spend some more quality time with the install disks.

&gt;<i> since there is no such lib already on the target system,
</I>
You might try 'find / -name &quot;libstdc++*&quot;' on the target system just to
make sure.

&gt;<i> i found a lib like this on the avr32-linux compiler directory and ftp'd
</I>&gt;<i> it to the avr32 and made a symbolic like with the desired name
</I>
Making the symlink is part of it, but ldconfig does some additional
magic as well.

&gt;<i> and now the loader says '/lib/libstdc++.so.6' is not an ELF file
</I>
You could try 'file /lib/libstdc++.so.6' on the target system to see
what kind of file it is (if you've got the 'file' command on the
target system).  Even if not, the 'file' command on your desktop system
should tell you: 'file /path/to/avr-compiler/lib/libstdc++.so.6'.

&gt;<i> is there a way to tell the configure script for gpsd to completely
</I>&gt;<i> link the gpsd exe to all shared libs so it wont need any shared libs
</I>&gt;<i> at run time?
</I>
This is usually called &quot;static linking&quot;.  You might try adding
'--disable-shared --enable static' to your configure command line to
see if that does what you want.  One way you can tell is that the
resulting executables will be much larger than what you have now.
