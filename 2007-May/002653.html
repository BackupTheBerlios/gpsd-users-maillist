<PRE>Hate to keep replying back to myself but I found a solution this time :).

Mark, I made the change you suggested

 &gt;    received = gpsdata-&gt;online = timestamp();

&gt;<i>to
</I>
&gt;<i>     received = timestamp();
</I>
and gpsdata-&gt;online was not being updated as I said below but then it occured to me that I need to change my query now to include &quot;x&quot;.  My query is now &quot;w+px\n&quot; and now it works like I want.

Maybe gps_poll() shouldn't update gpsdata-&gt;online if gps_poll is called from gps_query?  Or maybe it would be better to have a separate variable in gps_data_t.  One for the response from the query &quot;x&quot; and one for after the read from poll().

</I>&gt;<i>In gps_unpack(), online gets set to -1 if the response from the daemon
</I>&gt;<i>contains &quot;X=?&quot;, or the number if the reponse contains &quot;X=[number]&quot;.
</I>
This is the behavior I expected to see and this is what I see when I telnet to gpsd and execute &quot;x&quot;.  After I unplug the gps, &quot;x&quot; returns the last timestamp gpsd got data and it does not change, but in my application, the gpsdata-&gt;online is different after every query().

&gt;<i>gps_unpack() is called by gps_poll().  Right before gps_poll() calls
</I>&gt;<i>gps_unpack(), gps_poll() also updates online.  I'm not sure why
</I>&gt;<i>gps_poll() updates online - possibly this is a bug?
</I>
&gt;<i>gps_query() calls gps_poll() , which updates online before calling
</I>&gt;<i>gps_unpack() .
</I>
gps_query() calls gps_poll()?  Then why doesn't gps_query() block like gps_poll() does?  When I changed my application to use poll, instead of query, my gps collector thread would block on poll() if the gps was disconnected but this did not happen when I was using query.


&gt;<i>I don't know if this will break other things, but if you've compiled
</I>&gt;<i>gpsd from source or can do so, it might be interesting to change line
</I>&gt;<i>526 of libgps.c (as shipped with gpsd-2.34) from
</I>
 &gt;    received = gpsdata-&gt;online = timestamp();

&gt;<i>to
</I>
&gt;<i>     received = timestamp();
</I>
By doing that, gpsdata-&gt;online is no longer updated even when gps is connected which is the opposite of my previous problem :).

Looking at libgps, I see now where gps_query calls gps_poll which is incredibly odd since gps_query doesn't block but poll does.  I'm guessing that since query is not blocking, the timestamp is getting updated because poll is returning.

It's possible that when I call query and pass the query string &quot;w+p\n&quot; this writes the query to gpsd and gpsd replies with a ? or other response so the read statement in poll has something to read and therefore returns and gpsdata-&gt;online gets updated.  

I guess I need to figure out a different way to determine if the gps is connected since I can't have poll blocking my gps collector thread.  I could change the attributes of the gps_fd so the read won't block but I'm sure that's a bad idea.

Marshall
