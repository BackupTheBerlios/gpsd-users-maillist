I saw that.  :)  I was looking at the code with an eye to &quot;OK, if gpsd
does decode the wind messages, where should the data go?&quot;  Most all of
the data from $GP___ messages can go into the gps_fix_t structure,
because it all deals with GPS.  But there doesn't seem to be an existing
place to stick data from other kinds of messages.  This is just on the
&quot;parse and store data&quot; side; it doesn't address how you get the data
back out to a client - via new commands, or extra fields in existing
commands, or what.

&gt;<i> I'd argue that {wind,water} direction, velocity, temperature, pressure

</I>&gt;<i> the position of the navigation set (or the phase center of its

</I>
I would argue that they are irrelevant to the _current_ position of the
GPS antenna, but they have a lot to say about where the GPS antenna
_will_ be after a while.  In a mobile application, knowing precisely
where you are (GPS lat/lon/alt) is only half of the battle.  Generally,
you're trying to get somewhere, and you'd like some guidance on how best
to do that.

In a car, this information comes from the map database - you tell the
device where you want to go, and it looks up the associated lat/lon of
that point.  The device knows where you are based on the GPS signal.
Since the car is constrained to the road network, it then picks out
roads from the database that will get you headed towards your
destination.

On a boat, a map database alone might not be enough.  It can help with
things like not running into shallow rocks or staying in the center of a
channel, but otherwise, the boat isn't constrained to a fixed set of
paths - you can go where you want.  The device can't say &quot;turn left on
4th Street&quot;, but it can say &quot;sail along a heading of 50 degrees.&quot;  You
then need heading information - either from the GPS or a magnetic
compass - to navigate successfully.

In a small powerboat, you could conceivably just chase the GPS heading,
while the device tells you &quot;go two degrees right... OK, now go three
degrees left... OK, three right&quot;.  In a sailboat, it helps to have more
information about the environment, so you can sail in the right direction.
If you're due west of where you want to be, the GPS will tell you &quot;sail
along a heading of 90 degrees&quot;.  But if the wind is straight out of the
north, and you try to point the boat due east, you're going to end up
sailing right past your target on the south side.  You've got to sail
northeast, in a direction determined by how hard the wind is blowing and
the performance of your boat... the wind speed and direction _is part
of_ the navigation solution.  It's nice if the information on the wind
shows up in the same place as the information from the GPS, which is why
people might want gpsd to handle both.

An airplane has somewhat similar considerations to a boat.  You need a
map database for things like &quot;don't fly right over the middle of LAX at
an altitude of 500 feet&quot; or &quot;if you're flying west from Denver and you
aren't at least 15,000 feet above sea level, watch out for the cumulus
granitus&quot;.  But outside of that, you can fly where you want.  You don't
usually have an external instrument for wind speed and direction,
because it's pretty easy to tell from the pilot's seat what the wind is
doing.  But you might have other external instruments - a pressure or
radar altimeter for better altitude accuracy than GPS can give you, or
maybe heading and distance information from pre-GPS electronic
navigational aids (VOR/DME).  Again, it's nice if all your navigation
information shows up in the same place, so that's why people might want
gpsd to handle more than just gps.

&gt;<i> I say &quot;If&quot; because I'm unconvinced that we want to get into the
</I>&gt;<i> business of parsing non-gps data.
</I>
Another way to state this question might be: is this gpsd, or navd?  Do
you only care about GPS, or do you want to extend it to deal with other
kinds of navigation information as well?

&gt;<i> If we did go that way, it would be good to have a copy of the NMEA spec.
</I>
Something else that might help: some kind of effort to collect log file
data from actual devices.  Having the spec is nice, but it looks like
different vendors don't always implement the NMEA GPS messages the same
way - it's probably not wise to expect them to handle the other NMEA
messages the same way either.  Having log file data lets you see what's
happening in the &quot;real world&quot;, and also allows you to automate tests of
the parser.

&gt;<i> Finally, I'm worried about the stability of the state machine; It's
</I>&gt;<i> somewhat frightening how much noise looks like a valid protocol
</I>&gt;<i> message, at least for a few characters. I've seen instances where a
</I>&gt;<i> bunch of noise was mistake for NMEA because it happened to have $GP
</I>&gt;<i> in it...
</I>
Well, you can make the state machine/parser &quot;smarter&quot;, which
unfortunately is sometimes an alternate spelling of &quot;more brittle&quot;.
The probability of noise containing &quot;$GP[A-Z][A-Z][A-Z],&quot; is less than
the probability of noise containing just &quot;$GP&quot;.  Like the comments in
packet.c say, if you're pretty sure another sentence is coming in a
second, it's not a bad idea to just give up on a mal-formed sentence.
On the other hand, if the sentences don't come that often (non-GPS
sensors?) or if they do come often but your vehicle is fast *, it's
not such a good idea.

Matt Roberds

* &quot;There's no reason to become alarmed, and we hope you'll enjoy the
rest of your flight. By the way, is there anyone on board who knows
how to fly a plane?&quot;
