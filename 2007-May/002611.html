</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I was reading through your website, and found only a sheet with 'poor

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and just a few excellent. So my first question would be, what's the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> difference in good and excellent? And which would would be recommended
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> by you guys?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've stopped marking devices as &quot;excellent&quot; ... it's either &quot;good&quot; or
</I>&gt;<i> not.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Good (good enough) means that there are likely to be drivers, we can
</I>&gt;<i> easily parse the protocol and get useful data to you.  Less than good
</I>&gt;<i> means that we have to do stupid tricks to get the receiver into a
</I>&gt;<i> useful state, or the data is often erroneous, there are build quality
</I>&gt;<i> problems, non-portable kernel modules may be needed, ...
</I>well, i found an local online shop that actually carried an 'excellent'
marked unit, so i ordered it straight away, 69Euro's. Hopefully it'll
arrive before I go on my trip next thursday.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'm looking into buying a cheap(ish) bluetooth/USB (no serial on my
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> laptop) GPS unit and it must work in linux, as I don't have windows.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not terribly fond of bluetooth.
</I>&gt;<i> 1) yet another device spraying in the 2.4GHz ISM band
</I>&gt;<i> 2) yet another device sucking batteries
</I>&gt;<i> 3) many bluetooth devices are buggy and don't respond well to serial
</I>&gt;<i> speed changes
</I>&gt;<i> 4) bluetooth is still needlessly complicated.
</I>Dunno about 4 or 3, but I totally agree with 1 and 2. I don't like
everything being wireless either, my mouse is just fine with a cord
thank you :) stupid empty batteries all of the time, very annoying. And
yeah, only more noice in the ether, Wireless is not bad, I love my wifi
on my laptop, but having it everywhere is just nasty I think.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> also, I don't run linux or have any bluetooth adapters. I haven't got
</I>&gt;<i> around to hacking in usb support to my bluetooth-only GP-821.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Your receiver have a prolific or ftdi controller - a silicon labs or
</I>&gt;<i> USB ACM controller may be acceptable, though silicon laboratories
</I>&gt;<i> don't release programming documentation, so open source drivers for
</I>&gt;<i> this chipset may be buggy (works on my trimble and itrax though).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You should be able to avoid needing crazy kernel modules (like those
</I>&gt;<i> required for some magellan or garmin receivers)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Your recevier should have a reasonably well documented chipset - SiRF,
</I>&gt;<i> Trimble, ANTARIS, Garmin are pretty good. iTrax may also be acceptable
</I>&gt;<i> - I've got a working useful iTalk decoder, but there are some gaps in
</I>&gt;<i> their documentation.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Depending on your usage, you may need a higher sensitivity receiver.
</I>&gt;<i> SiRF3 does a pretty good job of locking on to a signal, at the cost of
</I>&gt;<i> some accuracy. In a side-by-side of (sirf2, sirf3, itrax3, lassen-iq)
</I>&gt;<i> test in an urban canyon, only the sirf3 and itrax3 got signal, but
</I>&gt;<i> there was a lot more randomness in the sirf3 solutions. The logs from
</I>&gt;<i> the itrax were also fairly noisy, but they were a lot closer to the
</I>&gt;<i> path I walked.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Uhm, that's just really technical, and though I should be able to grasp
all of this, I'm only like ... sure ... okay .. :)
As for the unit I picked, is a SiRF3, so that should be good?
&gt;<i> Find some candidate receivers, and then ask one of us (probably me)
</I>&gt;<i> what I think.
</I>
Well here goes then, one of the excellent marked units was the: Haicom
HI-204 III USB GPS Receiver using the SiRFstarIII-chipset.
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.gpsshop.nl/product/25898/haicom-hi-204-iii-usb-gps-receiver.html">http://www.gpsshop.nl/product/25898/haicom-hi-204-iii-usb-gps-receiver.html</A>&gt;
&gt;<i>From your website I gathered that HI-204S
</I>&lt;<A HREF="http://www.haicom.com.tw/products.htm">http://www.haicom.com.tw/products.htm</A>&gt; Excellent SiRFstarII USB
(PL2303) so all should be well, though I have no clue (yet) what SiRF
firmware level 231ES (XTrac). Haicom provided a test unit. Manual states
incorrectly that VTG is off by default. is about, i'm sure all should be
well?
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> CK
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Also, on a far far site note, in a few years from now, we will see the
galileo and maybe other satelite networks. Any idea if gps dongles would
work on that network aswell? I'd think not, but if they'd speak the
'known' protocols, gpsd shouldn't have a problem with it right?
