<PRE>Ok - i went back to verify that i could build a statically linked
gpsd from the standard source distribution on an x86 ubuntu system from
gpsd-2.34

i went back to my ubuntu system and did the following:

1.unzipped and untarred the source archive for gpsd-2.34
2. ./configure --disable-shared --enable-static
3. make
4. make install
5. cd /usr/sbin
6. file gpsd
the message says that the file is dynamicaly linked and uses shared libs!

what did i do wrong?  i was expecting to see a statically linked executable using no shared libs.


Next on the ubuntu system i went through the same process  and built ncurses for avr32 so it 
would find that.  Then built the gpsd.   I ran the 'file' command against the executable for avr32 and it says
that the file is dynamic and uses shared libraries.  I sent the file to the avr dev system and it is 
still trying to load the libstdc++.so.6 but cant becuase my local lib is not right.  so i still need to
get a static link on the dev system linked to everything including this.

I went back to my ubuntu dev system and found that the lib that is present in /usr/avr32-linux/lib is called
libstdc++.so.6.0.8 with symlinks libstdc++.so and libstdc++.so.6 so it seems that the
linker should be finding these libraries and performing a static link but its not.

The same thing seems to happen on the host system when i compile in native mode.
The executable file is much larger linked this way but may not be completely linked to
all the archives.

Is there a utility that will display the unlinked archives and can link everything?  or, is libtool
not being passed the correct parms to cause the complete static link to occur?

if i can get this lib to link i should be there or at least very close!

thanks for the ideas so far.  its getting clearer as i go.

Thanks,

Randy Rainwater
