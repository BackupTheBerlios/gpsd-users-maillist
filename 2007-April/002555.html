&gt;<i> Thanks Chris. I appreciate the response. I have just been reading up on the

Sounds like a project my cat has on the go. GPS tracking of his toy
mice. Just kidding, there's lots of cool stuff to do with gps, if you
can get the data out of a receiver easily. :)

Yachts, eh? GPSD 2.35 will be able to pass through !AI___ messages
from automated identification systems, like those from milltech
marine. Grab the latest from SVN if you want to try that out.

&gt;<i> The one issue I have to
</I>&gt;<i> get around is that the gentleman I am working for on this project has
</I>&gt;<i> patents/IP protection (NDAs etc) in mind ... which obviously does not work
</I>&gt;<i> in with the open source philosophy. He has asked me to seek commercial
</I>&gt;<i> relationships with any tools I use. On the other hand the application of
</I>&gt;<i> GPSD in the application we are developing is in fact nothing special - so I
</I>&gt;<i> am sure that I can convince him, in this regard at least, to open source the
</I>&gt;<i> code we produce.

As we say on the vendor cooperation page: &quot;We're not partial in our
benevolence. We write code to solve our problems and because we love a
good knotty technical challenge; we'll cheerfully add value to
anybody's product, if they'll cooperate with us.&quot;

As I attempted to explain to a vendor earlier last month, GPSD aims to
be an abstraction layer to the hardware. We want to be infrastructure.
GPSD is it's free for any and all uses. You're welcome to use GPSD as
part of the control system for a proprietary cruise missile... just
make sure you file a flight plan. We'll just be proud that you chose
us.

At the conclusion of your project, you're welcome to donate your code
to the project (under a BSD license) if you're authorized to do so,
but we certainly don't demand it. We hack GPSD for fun, and because it
solves problems for us. We may as well let others use it too, so they
don't need to waste time on previously-solved problems.

Eric, Gary and I all do consulting work. It's not inconceivable for a
consultant to be engaged to support the integration of an open-source
product into a proprietary, business-critical workflow. In fact, I do
that all the time. If your client asks you to deliver a result, and
you're able to deliver that cost-effectively by using GPSD... great,
we've done what we set out to do: simplify GPS. After all this, if
your client still feels like he has to lay down a pile of cash to be
sure we won't sue him, point him at our wishlist. We could use some
eval / dev kits. Or survey receivers. :)
