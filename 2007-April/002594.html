Good point Matt. When I first started on this a few weeks back I was
watching the rs232 port (on a windows computer) - but back then I could have
had wiring issues as I have progressed on that side of things since then. I
will give Minicom a go (on my linux laptop connected via USB) and see how it
goes. Will report back.

I hope it has not got creative. I suspect that it is not firing through nmea
sentences at all, but will see what is happening with minicom.
