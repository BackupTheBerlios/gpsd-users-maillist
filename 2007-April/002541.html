I don't think debian has ever been tarred by rumors that they blindly
rush into shipping the very latest, bleeding edge, pre-alpha code...
I'm pretty sure that the package maintainers for several BSDs and
several Linux distributions are lurking on the lists; I'll let them
unlurk if they so desire. I'm just trying to make sure they don't have
to add too many ugly hacks to make gpsd run or fit with their
packaging model ... so long as we don't need ugly hacks either.

&gt;<i> The good news is I managed to recompile it again, and it worked this
</I>&gt;<i> time, so I'm not sure if it was you or me that caused the binding error
</I>&gt;<i> on localhost!
</I>
I'm pretty sure that was my fault. That patch was a quick hack that
worked on my machine but didn't get enough testing on others. I forgot
to clean it out of my tree before I built the snapshot.

&gt;<i> Anyhow, my journey to work logged nicely, so yes looks like the new
</I>&gt;<i> version has got the right parsing for this code.
</I>
Yay!

&gt;<i> Is there anywhere I can add this device to show its compatibility, as
</I>&gt;<i> its not your average GPS receiver!

&gt;<i> Many many thanks Chris, appreciate your assistance with it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> On a side-note, I'm not sure who does the deb building for the project
</I>&gt;<i> at present but I'm happy to test out deb packages on my setup here
</I>
I don't think we have any deb builders. You're welcome to help us
remedy that situation though. ;)

GDB has a 'break' feature; why doesn't it have 'fix' too?
