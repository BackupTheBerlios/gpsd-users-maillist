I tried running just './configure' with no options and it set up to
install in /usr .  This seems to be pretty common among programs that
use GNU Autoconf.

I suspect that Autoconf predates the wide use of packaged binaries
(RPMs, Debian packages, etc) and it was then reasonable to assume that
if you built some software, you most likely wanted it to go into /usr .
Now I suspect it's slightly more common for admins to let only the
package manager put things in /usr , and to put stuff built from source
into /usr/local .
Recently, I've built/installed libpcap, Kismet, Wireshark, tcpdump, Wi-Spy Tools,  GPSd and RRDtools. Only RRDtools behaved differntly than the rest - It chose to install itself in /usr/local/rrdtools.

You may be having the same trouble I had.  xgps won't get built unless
configure finds all of the X libraries it is looking for.  You can tell
by looking at the configure output - it will have lines like
&quot;checking for libXfoo... no&quot; which means it didn't find one of the X
libraries.  The little summary that prints out at the end of the
configure script will still say something like &quot;X support... yes&quot; even
if it didn't find all the libraries, but it won't build xgps.

I'm on Debian and I had to install some of the X development packages to
get configure to find everything it wanted and build xgps.  On Debian,
and I think on RedHat and other systems that use RPM packages, these
packages typically have names that end in &quot;-devel&quot; or &quot;-dev&quot;.

I submitted a patch to the gpsd authors to make configure be a little
more vocal about not building xgps when it can't find one of the X
libraries.  I suspect this change will be in 2.35 .
I'll re-run autoconf.sh and pay closer attention.
&gt;<i> 3. `make install` does not installs some of the executables in a way

You posted later that running ldconfig fixed this.  I've had to do this
before, sometimes, after installing new software, but a lot of packages
that use Autoconf will run ldconfig for you after they install the new
programs and libraries.  You were probably root (or used sudo) when you
ran 'make install' - otherwise how would the stuff get put in /usr/local ,
on a system with the usual permissions? -  but if not, the automatic
ldconfig step might not have worked.
Yes - I used sudo for the final step (i.e., `sudo make install`). Updating the cache manually, as root fixed this problem.

Thanks, Matt!
