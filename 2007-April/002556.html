Cool - I will look at that.

We may take you up on this. John (the guy I am working for) is back from
another one of his holidays next week, so will see what he wants to do. Our
destination platform is a DashDAQ - ARM  - box so soon I will get my hands
on one of these and will need to port everything on to it. May need some
help on that or maybe it has already been done?

I have done some GPS work before when I developed a BREW application called
Mapion Local Search which is now retailing in Japan through KDMA. I really
enjoyed that ... it is a pointing application developed for GeoVector. So,
am really pleased to have landed this great project - will make 2007 very
interesting for me!
