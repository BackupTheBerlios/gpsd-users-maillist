</I>
A couple of addenda:
* My day job is at a University, and we have groups on campus doing
proprietary research. Sometimes a project isn't allowed out of the
lab, sometimes people choose a licence because that's what all the
cool kids are using, sometimes they choose a license for very specific
reasons (ie. maximum reusability, defense against people closing up
the code, satisfying commercial interests, whatever.)
* License changes are hard. They're not agonizingly difficult with a
small number of contributors whose primary motivation is writing
nifty, reusable code. They're very difficult when you have to start
involving lawyers and the technology transfer office. It may be that
each of the GPSTk developers is personally willing to use the BSD
license but they have a corporate policy to use GPL. I don't know -
I'm just suggesting that there may be more factors at play than we are
currently aware of. I will let the GPSTk project speak for themselves
when there is actual data on the subject.

&gt;<i> As for GPStk, it's GPL so it's free enough. It already has a standard,
</I>
My bad. It's LGPL - a significant difference. I need to watch my mouth.

&gt;<i> well defined import interface: RINEX. That's why I indicated our
</I>&gt;<i> biggest milestone towards integration or interoperability with any
</I>&gt;<i> postprocessing tools is our (currently non-existent) ability to write
</I>&gt;<i> RINEX. I don't think we really need to agitiate for another interface,
</I>&gt;<i> or try to import their code wholesale. I'm not even sure its within
</I>&gt;<i> the scope of our project to do so. GPSD is all about getting the live
</I>&gt;<i> data out of an arbitary receiver - GPStk is about postprocessing.
</I>&gt;<i> Distinct, yet complimentary tasks to be handled by domain experts.
</I>
Talking with Rick and Ben from the GPSTk project, I was made aware of
a couple of other nice formats we may want to consider, namely BINEX
and RT-IGS. From a quick skimming of RT-IGS it has the advantage of
being able to transport observations as well as metadata; something
that MACM can't do but RINEX can. Unfortunately RINEX isn't really
well suited to real time / streaming processing.

&gt;<i> And for all my apparent anti-GPL venom, I don't have a problem with
</I>&gt;<i> it; I just don't want to mix licenses. I do keep abreast of GPStk's
</I>&gt;<i> changes, and send them patches. They seem like a reasonable bunch:
</I>&gt;<i> send them a change request (possibly with a diff) and a good
</I>&gt;<i> justification and they accept it. If a convincing case could be made
</I>&gt;<i> that switching GPL-&gt;BSD is in their benefit they may switch, but
</I>&gt;<i> that'd be a hard sell. Lawyers and technology transfer offices get
</I>&gt;<i> involved...
</I>
License mixtures, even with dual licensing are tricky. Very tricky.

GDB has a 'break' feature; why doesn't it have 'fix' too?
