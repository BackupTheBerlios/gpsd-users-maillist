Assuming you are on a Linux-ish system:

Often, devices like this contain a USB-to-serial chip.  There are
several of these chips and it's possible that you don't have the drivers
for the chip in the TackTick.  When you plug the TackTick into your USB
port, the kernel is probably giving some messages about what it's
finding.  You can usually use the 'dmesg' command to see the most recent
kernel messages.

For instance, when I plug in my Navman GPS with its own USB-to-serial
converter, I see this in the dmesg output:

---
usb 2-1: new low speed USB device using ohci_hcd and address 3
usb 2-1: config 1 interface 0 altsetting 0 has an invalid endpoint with address 0x0, skipping
usb 2-1: configuration #1 chosen from 1 choice
navman 2-1:1.0: navman converter detected
usb 2-1: navman converter now attached to ttyUSB0
---

No matter what, you'll probably see the first two or three lines - the
ones that start with &quot;usb 2-1&quot; in the example - as the USB subsystem
recognizes that you plugged *something* in.  If you get nothing at all,
either your kernel has been told to be very quiet about what messages
it sends, or there is a more fundamental problem with the USB subsystem.

If you don't have the right driver for your serial chip, you'll probably
never get the last couple of lines, which indicate that the specific
serial chip was recognized and assigned an entry in /dev - in this case,
/dev/ttyUSB0 .

Even if you don't have the right driver, you might be able to plug in
the TackTick and use the 'lsusb' command to get a hint as to what kind
of serial chip it contains.  Then you need to consult the documentation
for your distribution (Debian, Fedora, etc) and/or your kernel to figure
out how to get that driver added.
