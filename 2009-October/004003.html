<PRE>Eric,

&gt;<i> &gt; Just a little disclaimer, yes, I know the longer sentences violate the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; sentence length limit of NMEA-0183. GPSD seems to be more than happy to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; parse the sentences anyway. I'll eventually add in the (simple) logic to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; split up sentences, just to be safe.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As far as GPSD is concerned, don't worry about it. Lots of GPS
</I>&gt;<i> receivers violate that limit in odd ways, as we've found out the hard
</I>&gt;<i> way over the last five years.  The packet buffer in GPSD is far longer
</I>&gt;<i> than any AIS encoding will ever be.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Thanks for the heads-up.

&gt;<i> &gt; Feel free to give me suggestions, comments, etc. on this program. If
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; there are GNU Radio aficionados out there who don't have access to the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; USRP hardware, I can record some sample AIS data for people to play
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; with. Just let me know.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> One of the things I want most badly for this project is a complete AIVDM
</I>&gt;<i> test load - significant portions of my decoders have not yet been tested
</I>&gt;<i> on live data, and not because I haven't been looking.  If you could supply
</I>&gt;<i> any of the missing types I'd be very grateful.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I have regression-test loads for AIS types 1-11, 15, 18-21, and 24.  I
</I>&gt;<i> don't have them for types 12-14, 16-17, and 22-23.  
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> A proper test load includes both the sentence and the decoded output
</I>&gt;<i> oin some human-readable form - but for messages 12 and 14 in
</I>&gt;<i> particular I'll take any data I can get, as the payload is textual and
</I>&gt;<i> it ought therefore to be easy to tell if the decoding is correct.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For types 6 and 8 I have regression-test sentences but no independent
</I>&gt;<i> check that I've got the binary payload right.  If you have any known-good
</I>&gt;<i> receivers you're checking your homebrew one against, perhaps you can help.
</I>
Well, since I'm not doing the decoding, but rather the demodulation and
the sentence assembly, it's pretty easy to validate the data-- if it
demodulates correctly and passes checksum, I'm probably doing it right,
as all AIS transmissions are constructed in an identical fashion at the
physical layer. I don't have a known-good receiver to test the gpsd AIS
sentence decoding against, unfortunately. I'll set up a background task
to filter out new sentences for you, and give you what I find, but thus
far I haven't seen any of the more exotic AIS sentences.

Nick
