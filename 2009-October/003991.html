<PRE>The GPSD project is in the midst of an emergency due to the apparemnt
death or near death of its hosting site, berlios.de.  The project
mailing lists seem still to be functioning, but I'm not counting on
that to continue.  You can help by doing the following.

* Reply to this mail indicating which mailing list you are on,
  in case I can't rescue our mailing list data before the listserv's
  web interface dies.

* Watch the #gpsd project IRC channel at Freenode, 

      <A HREF="irc://irc.freenode.net/gpsd">irc://irc.freenode.net/gpsd</A>

  for status update in real time.  When we have a new hosting site
  I'll announce it there first.

The project code and website content have been successfully recovered.
I will bring them up on a new hosting site as quickly as possible.

Here are more details:

Around 1400 EST on Friday, the gpsd project website at berlios became
inaccessible and Subversion access stopped working. I became aware of
this very quickly as I was hacking code and doing commits when it
happened.

Berlios's performance had been deteriorating for months, so I decided
not to bet on the site coming back soon - or, for that matter, ever
again. Accordingly, I immediately began taking recovery actions.
Chris and I had been planning to move to a better hosting site;
unfortunately this crash caught us only half prepared.

Best news first: thanks to sanooj's git mirror, an SVN dump I saved in
mid-September to experiment on, and two days of hard work, I have
managed to reconstruct a complete revision history of the project
repository.  That means the code and the website content are safe.

A few minutes minutes ago that I learned that the mailing list
servers still appear to be up.  I am not betting that will continue,
Be aware that the list could go dead at any point, and please watch #gpsd.

I am presently trying to extract our mailing list data from the Mailman
instance on berlios.  This will not be easy; I may have to do some
serious Greasemonkey hacking to get it all.

I have a project start request in an gna.org.  I expect that to be 
approved Monday, after which I will do what is necessary to bring up
our repository there and create new mailing lists.  If you want to
be sure you're on them, reply to this mail.

Probably fewer than 2% of handguns and well under 1% of all guns will
ever be involved in a violent crime. Thus, the problem of criminal gun
violence is concentrated within a very small subset of gun owners,
indicating that gun control aimed at the general population faces a
serious needle-in-the-haystack problem.
