Correct - from memory my rule with udev-141 needed to be something like:

KERNEL==&quot;ttyUSB[0-9]*&quot; RUN=etc

Anything more exact than that would not match.  Actually I *think* I 
couldn't even match the tty subsystem (not at the machine to test)

Additionally as you have presumably discovered, the choice of kernel is 
important because certain kernels around the 2.6.29/30 ish time frame 
exhibit a similar bug to what you describe? I think I moved to 2.6.30.6 
- I don't have it running at present, but I believe that I probably 
picked that because it was working ok...

You could also try varying the udev version you are using?  I'm on 
gentoo here so that's quite easy to do, but perhaps your distro has a 
variety of options available...? Consider raising this particular issue 
further on the udev/kernel list, but be sure to simplify your problem to 
a simple script which just prints hello to a log file or similar... 
(this is the simplest way to debug things)

Oh, additionally note that the gpsd supplied udev script causes udev to 
hang indefinitely on a subset of udev versions - the gentoo init script 
is modified to run the gpsd bits in a separately forked thread.  It 
appears to make no difference on the version that I am using, but it's 
worth noting this potentially problem isn't biting you?  Debug it by 
disabling the ADD part of the rules, run the script manually from the 
command line and then debug the remove events only..?

Good luck

Ed W
