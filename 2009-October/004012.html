</I>Ed, an update on this. Other people have found a similar problem viz:
<A HREF="http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/programming-9/udev-not-called-to-remove-open-usb-serial-device-585603/">http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/programming-9/udev-not-called-to-remove-open-usb-serial-device-585603/</A>
Essentially the kernel does not create a Kernel event for removing an
open serial device. It also looks like it fails to alert the driver and
the application that the device has vanished.

Looking at
<A HREF="http://lkml.indiana.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0907.2/01845.html">http://lkml.indiana.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0907.2/01845.html</A> it
would appear to be a bug in the kernel being worked on as recently as
July 09. Follow that thread by Alan Stern and Alan Cox which implies
that the solution is not going to be easy. The problem also has kernel
reliability impacts (though not for my case).
Now, I am not familiar with writing UDEV rules, but I am even less
familiar with patching the Linux kernel so going down that route is not
an option for me. What I might try to do (at least temporarily) is to
fire a rule based on the USB remove event which IS fired (as opposed to
a tty event which is not) just for my particular device.
