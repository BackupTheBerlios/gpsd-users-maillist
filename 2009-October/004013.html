</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Please use udev monitor and check the exact events.  Then simplify your

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> about why it's not firing. In my case I need a udev rule which is simply
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> matched on any ttyUSB event, no matter what driver...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ed, I failed to mention that the original &quot;remove&quot; rule is:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ACTION=&quot;remove&quot;, RUN+=&quot;/lib/udev/gpsd.hotplug.wrapper&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> the only thing that bypasses that rule is: if the subsystem is not tty
</I>&gt;<i> all the gpsd rules are ignored including this one. I think that the
</I>&gt;<i> above rule is about as simple as possible.
</I>&gt;<i> So I have to figure out why some other rule does not think that the
</I>&gt;<i> receiver is a tty device. I don't like the idea of triggering the remove
</I>&gt;<i> for all possible subsystems e.g. when I remove a USB DVD drive.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What I think I have to do is find out what rules are being fired for the
</I>&gt;<i> device and, as you wrote, find out why the add rules identify the device
</I>&gt;<i> as tty but the remove rules do not.  I can do that once I can figure out
</I>&gt;<i> from the logs which UDEV rules are actually being triggered for &quot;add&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> since there seems to be quite a lot of them in the directory.

Warren Free pointed out that I had made an error above. The original &quot;remove&quot; rule was:
ACTION==&quot;remove&quot;, RUN+=&quot;/lib/udev/gpsd.hotplug.wrapper&quot;
== not =

However, I now have further information. I am coming to believe that the problem
of the /dev/ttyUSBx not vanishing may well be unsolvable without either totally killing
the gpsd daemon or the behaviour of the Linux kernel tty subsystem being fixed.
I fixed the UDEV rules so that the remove script is called, albeit with a device name not
of the form /dev/ttyUSBx
First I suspected that the name given caused the problem, but a few debug statements
showed that gpsd was being sent the close command for &quot;remove&quot;. For anyone interested the
log below shows that, even with the gpsd NOT holding open /dev/ttyUSB0, it still does
not vanish on unplug. Only killing the daemon seems to do that. The log below is
commented with the actions I took. If anyone can see a flaw with the logic, I would
be very interested. The lines beginning $ are the commands, the rest the responses.

$ #This is test with fix applied so that &quot;remove&quot; is called.
$ #The machine has just been rebooted and the receiver is not plugged in.
$ #first look at ttyUSB devices
$ ls /dev/ttyU*
ls: cannot access /dev/ttyU*: No such file or directory
$ #none. Now plug in the receiver and test to see if gpsd is running
$ ls /dev/ttyU*
/dev/ttyUSB0
$ ps ax|grep gps
 3385 ?        S&lt;sl   0:00 gpsd -F /var/run/gpsd.sock
 3392 pts/0    S+     0:00 grep gps
$ #OK, ttyUSB0 is there and gpsd is running. Next check if it is open.
$ sudo fuser /dev/ttyUSB0
/dev/ttyUSB0:         3385
$ #Yes, gpsd has the device open. Here I unplug and look at state
$ ls /dev/ttyU*
/dev/ttyUSB0
$ #ttyUSB0 is still there, test gpsd existing and having it open
$ ps ax|grep gps
 3385 ?        S&lt;sl   0:01 gpsd -F /var/run/gpsd.sock
$ sudo fuser /dev/ttyUSB0
$ #no output from fuser so /dev/ttyUSB0 seems to be there and NOT open.
$ #next, kill the daemon and see if /dev/ttyUSB0 is still there
$ sudo kill -9 3385
$ ls /dev/ttyU*
ls: cannot access /dev/ttyU*: No such file or directory
$ #now it has gone. Perhaps it is a question of timing of closing because
$ #the script is forked. So here I plug in again and tell gpsd to
$ #close manually before unplugging the receiver.
$ ls /dev/ttyU*
/dev/ttyUSB0
$ ps ax|grep gps
 3637 ?        S&lt;sl   0:00 gpsd -F /var/run/gpsd.sock
$ sudo fuser /dev/ttyUSB0
/dev/ttyUSB0:         3637
$ #yes, /dev/ttyUSB0 is back, gpsd is running and has it open.
$ #call the gpsd remove script by hand before unplugging.
$ sudo /lib/udev/gpsd.hotplug remove /dev/ttyUSB0
$ sudo fuser /dev/ttyUSB0
$ #No output, therefore gpsd has definitely closed the connection
$ ps ax|grep gps
 3637 ?        S&lt;sl   0:00 gpsd -F /var/run/gpsd.sock
$ #but gpsd is still running. Here I unplug and see if ttyUSB0 goes
$ ps ax|grep gps
 3637 ?        S&lt;sl   0:00 gpsd -F /var/run/gpsd.sock
$ ls /dev/ttyU*
/dev/ttyUSB0
$ #no, /dev/ttyUSB0 is still present.
$ sudo fuser /dev/ttyUSB0
$ #Empty response so nothing has it open.
$ #So telling gpsd to disconnect is insufficient - apart from kill -9 what is sufficient?
