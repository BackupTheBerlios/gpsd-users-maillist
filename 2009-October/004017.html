</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Since the /lib/rules.d/40-gpsd.rules has a rule which says

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> tty, I suspect that there are NO tty rules being fired on the remove
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> event hence the gpsd rules are not even being tried.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Correct - from memory my rule with udev-141 needed to be something like:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> KERNEL==&quot;ttyUSB[0-9]*&quot; RUN=etc
</I>
Ed, I checked very carefully, there are NO kernel &quot;remove&quot; events containing the
string &quot;tty&quot;.  There are a few containing various &quot;USB&quot; keys which I have used
to trigger the remove of gpsd.
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Anything more exact than that would not match.  Actually I *think* I
</I>&gt;<i> couldn't even match the tty subsystem (not at the machine to test)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Additionally as you have presumably discovered, the choice of kernel is
</I>&gt;<i> important because certain kernels around the 2.6.29/30 ish time frame
</I>&gt;<i> exhibit a similar bug to what you describe? I think I moved to 2.6.30.6
</I>&gt;<i> - I don't have it running at present, but I believe that I probably
</I>&gt;<i> picked that because it was working ok...
</I>
OK, now you are getting beyond my capabilities. I have NO idea how good an
idea it is to replace a kernel in a particular distribution of Ubuntu.
You are correct, I am running on an older kernel that you. Jaunty in the
netbook remix flavour reports its kernel as &quot;Ubuntu 2.6.28-15-generic&quot;.
I have NO idea even how to rebuild that, never having built a kernel.
I am not sure my little netbook is the right place to build one either.
Presumeably there is a good chance that I would break something else?
Also, the next version of Ubuntu is due out before too long so I might
just wait for that.
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You could also try varying the udev version you are using?  I'm on
</I>&gt;<i> gentoo here so that's quite easy to do, but perhaps your distro has a
</I>&gt;<i> variety of options available...? Consider raising this particular issue
</I>&gt;<i> further on the udev/kernel list, but be sure to simplify your problem to
</I>&gt;<i> a simple script which just prints hello to a log file or similar...
</I>&gt;<i> (this is the simplest way to debug things)
</I>UDEV seems to be working just fine. I am pretty sure that it is the
kernel which is not working correctly. You will see from an earlier post
that I discovered a thread on the lists associated with the kernel about
the lack of remove events for tty that are held open (not just ttyUSB).
In one case (not mine) this was causing a kernel crash.
They were working on this in July of this year so perhaps that is now fixed.
Once I put in the rule to trigger on an existing kernel event, the remove
action was called correctly.
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Oh, additionally note that the gpsd supplied udev script causes udev to
</I>&gt;<i> hang indefinitely on a subset of udev versions - the gentoo init script
</I>&gt;<i> is modified to run the gpsd bits in a separately forked thread.  It
</I>&gt;<i> appears to make no difference on the version that I am using, but it's
</I>&gt;<i> worth noting this potentially problem isn't biting you?  Debug it by
</I>&gt;<i> disabling the ADD part of the rules, run the script manually from the
</I>&gt;<i> command line and then debug the remove events only..?
</I>I can see from the script that there was a problem.
All of the script is now run on a separate thread.
There was a deadlock condition. This seems to have been fixed in the
version I am using which now does a fork.
However, I did suspect that forking to another process was
the cause of the problem - I wondered if the delayed release of the ttyUSB
was the cause of it not vanishing. My last test (calling the release by hand)
showed that it did not matter how early the release was called, the ttyUSBx was
not being removed, despite no processes keeping it open and no device being
attached to it. What I intend to do is to try to write up these experiments
and results on a website to make them more understandable than this thread.
Thanks for all your help.
