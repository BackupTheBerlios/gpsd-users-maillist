</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Ed, I failed to mention that the original &quot;remove&quot; rule is:

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ACTION=&quot;remove&quot;, RUN+=&quot;/lib/udev/gpsd.hotplug.wrapper&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the only thing that bypasses that rule is: if the subsystem is not tty

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> above rule is about as simple as possible.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So I have to figure out why some other rule does not think that the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> receiver is a tty device. I don't like the idea of triggering the remove
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for all possible subsystems e.g. when I remove a USB DVD drive.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> What I think I have to do is find out what rules are being fired for the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> device and, as you wrote, find out why the add rules identify the device
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> as tty but the remove rules do not.  I can do that once I can figure out
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> from the logs which UDEV rules are actually being triggered for &quot;add&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> since there seems to be quite a lot of them in the directory.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      
</I>&gt;<i> Warren Free pointed out that I had made an error above. The original &quot;remove&quot; rule was:
</I>&gt;<i> ACTION==&quot;remove&quot;, RUN+=&quot;/lib/udev/gpsd.hotplug.wrapper&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> == not =
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> However, I now have further information. I am coming to believe that the problem
</I>&gt;<i> of the /dev/ttyUSBx not vanishing may well be unsolvable without either totally killing
</I>&gt;<i> the gpsd daemon or the behaviour of the Linux kernel tty subsystem being fixed.
</I>&gt;<i> I fixed the UDEV rules so that the remove script is called, albeit with a device name not
</I>&gt;<i> of the form /dev/ttyUSBx
</I>&gt;<i> First I suspected that the name given caused the problem, but a few debug statements
</I>&gt;<i> showed that gpsd was being sent the close command for &quot;remove&quot;. For anyone interested the
</I>&gt;<i> log below shows that, even with the gpsd NOT holding open /dev/ttyUSB0, it still does
</I>&gt;<i> not vanish on unplug. Only killing the daemon seems to do that. The log below is
</I>&gt;<i> commented with the actions I took. If anyone can see a flaw with the logic, I would
</I>&gt;<i> be very interested. The lines beginning $ are the commands, the rest the responses.

</I>&gt;<i> $ #no, /dev/ttyUSB0 is still present.
</I>&gt;<i> $ sudo fuser /dev/ttyUSB0
</I>&gt;<i> $ #Empty response so nothing has it open.
</I>&gt;<i> $ #So telling gpsd to disconnect is insufficient - apart from kill -9 what is sufficient?
</I>&gt;<i>    
</I>
Sorry to intrude, since I'm not sure if this is germane to the thread, 
but I also had an issue with gpsd holding on to devices it wasn't 
using.  But my case was bizarre: fuser showed gpsd was occupying 
/dev/parport0, the parallel port!  Killing gpsd released parport0, which 
I was using to control external hardware.

Bizarre.  I had mentioned it on this list when it first happened, but 
the response (primarily disbelief) was nothing I could make use of, 
despite many strace runs.

Fortunately, my GPS USB-serial interface (FTDI) had a 2K buffer, so my 
&quot;solution&quot; was to add a wrapper around my parallel port twiddling to do 
the following: Wait for the serial port to become idle (avoid 
interrupting a sentence), close the gpsd connection, kill gpsd, twiddle 
the parallel port, restart gpsd, then reopen the gpsd connection.  This 
was easily done fast enough to avoid GPS data loss.

It's a hack of the ugliest kind, but something similar may prove useful 
as part of a temporary solution for your problem.  In my case, it worked 
because one process managed both the gpsd connection and the parallel port.

In your case, you may want gpsd to be spawned/killed whenever your 
device is connected/removed.  Which means starting a gpsd instance for 
each USB-serial device when it appears, which in turn means that gpsd 
instances that do not find a GPS on a given USB serial port would need 
to be killed.

For this, it would be useful if gpsd had an option that would permit it 
to &quot;Attempt GPS discovery, then exit if no GPS found.&quot;  The equivalent 
can certainly be done manually by having the connect script start gpsd, 
sleep, attempt a connection, then kill gpsd if no connection is found.

A veritable stack o' hacks, but it may work until a better solution is 
found.

Perhaps the gpsd command-line options  '-b', '-n', '-N', the gpsd 
protocol commands  'b', 'f', 'g', 'k', 'n', and SIGHUP could also prove 
useful.

HTH,
