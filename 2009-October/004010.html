</I>OK, Ed, I have now logged some Kernel and UDEV rules. First can you tell
me if I am doing the right thing. I did:
sudo udevadm monitor

That gave me a lot of events with Kernel and UDEV at the beginning of
each line. What I have not yet managed to understand is exactly which
UDEV rule is actually firing on which event. There seems to be no
indication in the log as to which rule in which file is causing
anything. I can see the rules in /lib/rules.d/40-gpsd.rules

BUT what is interesting in the logs of the &quot;add&quot; event there are lots of
references to &quot;tty&quot;. In the &quot;remove&quot; event, there is not a single
reference to the letters &quot;tty&quot; in either the kernel or the UDEV events.
Since the /lib/rules.d/40-gpsd.rules has a rule which says
SUBSYSTEM!=&quot;tty&quot;, GOTO=&quot;gpsd_rules_end&quot; i.e. do nothing if it is not a
tty, I suspect that there are NO tty rules being fired on the remove
event hence the gpsd rules are not even being tried.

All I can think of doing is searching all the rules to try to figure out
why the 2303 device is being recognised as a tty device on add, but not
on remove.  Let me know if you are interested in the event logs and I
will post them on a website (a bit big for here).
