</I>&gt;<i>     Sure appreciate your reply!

No worries. We all have real world stuff that gets in the way...

&gt;<i> Quick question:  If I want a functional GPS unit
</I>&gt;<i> vs one that I will hope to get functioning some
</I>&gt;<i> day then neither Sony or Nemerix would be good
</I>&gt;<i> choices under gpsd and gpsdrive?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Or is the Sony and Nemerix functionality not
</I>&gt;<i> that bad, just incomplete in the details?
</I>
There are two things that can seriously get in your way with GPS:
interface and protocol. In your case, you're using bluetooth, so you
won't have a problem with some new-and-unsupported usb-serial chip
getting in your way. You might have a problem with the Serial Port
Profile on bluetooth if you attempt to adjust the device settings, but
if you're just expecting to turn it on and have NMEA coming out, then
you're in good shape.

The second issue is protocol: we are able to process UBX, SiRF, iTalk,
TSIP, Garmin, Evermore, Navcom, Zodiac... They're all proprietary
protocols, and we also process the industry-standard NMEA protocol,
which is what the BTG-7000 outputs by default.

Basically, we don't have the information or motivation at this time to
support any nifty features that may be provided by the Nemerix or Sony
chips. That being said, as long as they output generic NMEA, they will
work with gpsd.

&gt;<i>     I have purchased devices with questionable Linux
</I>&gt;<i> functionality in the past and in most cases they
</I>&gt;<i> have become paperweights.  I would really like to
</I>&gt;<i> acquire a Bluetooth GPS that works, even if a few
</I>&gt;<i> non-critical features are incomplete under Linux.
</I>&gt;<i> Mapping for traveling is one key feature I'd need
</I>&gt;<i> right away.
</I>
Overall, as a magic black box you should be OK. The BTG-7000 outputs
NMEA over the serial port profile. That's not the optimal
configuration, but it's enough to give you a straight answer to &quot;where
am i?&quot;

&gt;<i>     I will E-mail <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-users">Lewis.Boore at nemerix.com</A> and explain
</I>&gt;<i> the harm to sales that results from an uncooperative
</I>&gt;<i> policy.
</I>
I've already requested docs. They said something about NDA, I said I
didn't think that was necessary given the specifics of what I asked
for, and that was the last I ever heard of them.

Getting up on my soapbox for a moment: open documentation is important
to all of you. It means we can write and maintain drivers, and you can
validate our work. If you look in the list archives you'll see an
instance of me writing something to the hardware... backwards, and it
was caught by one of our sharp-eyed users. Documentation helps you get
more out of the hardware you bought, and helps maintain its
usefulness. Support vendors who provide documentation to the open
source community.

&gt;<i>     If I fall into an extra $35.99 to whom would I
</I>&gt;<i> send a Cellink BTG-7000 for reverse engineering?
</I>
Snail mail address via private email...

&gt;<i> &gt; Nemerix and Sony are both supported insofar as we can parse their
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; NMEA. They're not quite as supported as something like SiRF because we
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; don't have any sample hardware and full protocol docs. It's probably
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; good that we don't have specific protocol support for these two yet
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; because speed/protocol changes on bluetooth tend to be somewhat
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; problematic.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Sony's chip doesn't look like it does anything fancy to make binary
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; support worthwhile. Or maybe it's just their front end that is lame;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; iSuite from Fastrax (makers of iTrax) can use the Sony chip set and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; get lots of interesting data out of it. Nemerix is being uncooperative
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; about releasing the protocol documentation. If you'd like to help with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; getting Nemerix more supported, you can email <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-users">Lewis.Boore at nemerix.com</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and try explain how it'll help you to have the protocol specification
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; open.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Doc *and* hardware are important for ongoing device support.

GDB has a 'break' feature; why doesn't it have 'fix' too?
