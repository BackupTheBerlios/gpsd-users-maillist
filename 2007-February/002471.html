That's fine. Gpsd can switch it back to NMEA with the N command,
gpsctl should be able to kick it back as well.

&gt;<i> This is one of the little square gps units on a cable; see
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.deluoelectronics.com/">http://www.deluoelectronics.com/</A> and seems to contain the Sirf3 chipset.
</I>
I'm told that the SiRFstar 3 is not the optimal choice for precison
timing applications. For +/- 1 second though, it should be fine.

&gt;<i> I have configured ntpd to take time from gpsd 2.34-1 and the peer billboard
</I>&gt;<i> looks as follows:
</I>
It's been ages since I last used ntp.org as my time daemon.

&gt;<i> Now currently the time offset is 14 seconds, however I have seen the
</I>&gt;<i> difference be as large as 80 seconds.
</I>
14 seconds is understandable - leap seconds. Not sure where 80 is coming from.

&gt;<i> At night I seem to get 6 satelites and a reasonable fix however in the
</I>&gt;<i> daytime the fix can fail completely or drop to 1 or 2 satelites.
</I>&gt;<i> the unit sits on a window cill in our block of units; so perhaps the view of
</I>&gt;<i> the sky plays a part but I am wondering why I would see time errors
</I>&gt;<i> as large as 80 seconds?
</I>
Yes, I also live in an apartment with a GPS in the window; around here
I'm lucky if I get 4 satellites; often I get 2 and a ton of multipath
error.

I'm wondering if maybe it's something in SHM. I seem to recall hearing
that running gpsd at debug level 5 will give some insight into the
workings of SHM.

&gt;<i> I'm happy with 5 seconds either way worst case sanario but 80 seems a bit
</I>&gt;<i> wrong.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Running gpsprof -f cycle yields:
</I>&gt;<i> ...
</I>&gt;<i> I don't know Python but it seems as if gpsprof gets values that it does not
</I>&gt;<i> like which are out of sequence.
</I>
I don't know python either. ;)

&gt;<i> I read in the gpsd manpage that running in a binary protocol at reasonable
</I>&gt;<i> baudrate would improve accuracy or could do so.
</I>
It can reduce certain transmission delays, and running in binary mode
means you can get a full navigation solution in a single packet,
rather than having to reassemble it from NMEA sentences.

&gt;<i> The unit seems to return reasonable possition information when I query it
</I>&gt;<i> with the p command, and as previously stated q shows fixes between 3 and 6
</I>&gt;<i> satelites.
</I>
With 3 satellites you don't get a real 3d solution - you can make some
good guesses, but any receiver intended for timing use I've ever seen
insists on having at least 4 satellites.

&gt;<i> Is there anything I could try to potentially improve accuracy to below 5
</I>&gt;<i> seconds or to stop the unit from loosing fix? The gps time source appears to
</I>&gt;<i> occationally become unavailable which causes the server to lock onto another
</I>&gt;<i> time source and given the time differences stay locked onto that source.
</I>
&gt;<i> Am I expecting too much from a cheap SiRf3 unit? Should I go out and buy a
</I>&gt;<i> Garman or similar?
</I>
No, you're not expecting too much to be able to get time within a few seconds.

&gt;<i> I also have a couple of other gps units; wondering if it is worth trying one
</I>&gt;<i> of these.
</I>
Go for it... it can't hurt.

&gt;<i> I am happy to buy another gps unit for a time source but am trying not to
</I>&gt;<i> use a bluetooth unit if possible since I don't really want the 2.4 ghz radio
</I>&gt;<i> noise in the unit block and a cable seems more reliable potentially.
</I>
Heh. Bluetooth has its own issues, notably the tendency to not switch
port speed correctly. I prefer wired also.

&gt;<i> Any help or insight would be greatly apreciated. Happy to provide any debug
</I>&gt;<i> dumps or similar information including switching gps to NMEA or similar.
</I>
telnet to 127.0.0.1 port 2947 and send &quot;N=0&quot;

GDB has a 'break' feature; why doesn't it have 'fix' too?
