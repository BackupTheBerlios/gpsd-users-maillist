<PRE>Ok please forgive a relative newby as far as gps and gpsd is concerned. I 
hope I include all necessary information below.
I am running a deluo universal gps off a serial port.
Operating system is Debian Sarge 3.1 gpsd compiled from sources and Python 
2.3.

GPs identifies as:

gpsctl: /dev/gps identified as SiRF binary GSW3.2.2_3.1.00.12-SDK003P1.01a 
at 38400

I admit to switching it into SiRf Binary; afterall the device is cheap, I 
have a screwdriver and don't mind resetting the unit.

This is one of the little square gps units on a cable; see 
<A HREF="http://www.deluoelectronics.com/">http://www.deluoelectronics.com/</A> and seems to contain the Sirf3 chipset.
I have configured ntpd to take time from gpsd 2.34-1 and the peer billboard 
looks as follows:


=SHM(0)          127.0.0.1        0   16  377 0.00000 14.001217 0.01593
=SHM(1)          127.0.0.1        0   16    0 0.00000  0.000000 0.00000
=LOCAL(0)        127.0.0.1       13   64  377 0.00000  0.000000 0.03049
*my1.doubleukay. 203.161.xxx.xx   2  128  377 0.26994 -0.002388 0.09489
=merkur.baulogis 203.161.xxx.xx   2  128  377 0.40228  0.078595 0.08839

Now currently the time offset is 14 seconds, however I have seen the 
difference be as large as 80 seconds.
At night I seem to get 6 satelites and a reasonable fix however in the 
daytime the fix can fail completely or drop to 1 or 2 satelites.
the unit sits on a window cill in our block of units; so perhaps the view of 
the sky plays a part but I am wondering why I would see time errors
as large as 80 seconds?
I'm happy with 5 seconds either way worst case sanario but 80 seems a bit 
wrong.

Running gpsprof -f cycle yields:

gpsprof: looking for fix...first fix in 0.86sec, gathering 
samples......(93.68 sec) done.
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File &quot;/usr/bin/gpsprof&quot;, line 462, in ?
    sys.stdout.write(plotframe(await,formatter,speed,threshold,title))
  File &quot;/usr/bin/gpsprof&quot;, line 433, in plotframe
    command = plotter.plot(title, session)
  File &quot;/usr/bin/gpsprof&quot;, line 378, in plot
    sendcycle = min(*cycles.values())
TypeError: iteration over non-sequence

I don't know Python but it seems as if gpsprof gets values that it does not 
like which are out of sequence.

I read in the gpsd manpage that running in a binary protocol at reasonable 
baudrate would improve accuracy or could do so.

The unit seems to return reasonable possition information when I query it 
with the p command, and as previously stated q shows fixes between 3 and 6 
satelites.

Is there anything I could try to potentially improve accuracy to below 5 
seconds or to stop the unit from loosing fix? The gps time source appears to 
occationally become unavailable which causes the server to lock onto another 
time source and given the time differences stay locked onto that source.
Am I expecting too much from a cheap SiRf3 unit? Should I go out and buy a 
Garman or similar?
I also have a couple of other gps units; wondering if it is worth trying one 
of these.
I have a Globalsat BT338 and a Deluo bluetooth datalogger gps which I 
believe is based on the evermore chipset.
I also have a Sedio 2010 unit which seems incredibly capable at holding a 
fix even inside our 2-story concrete unit block.

Perhaps I should try one of these?

the reason for so many gps units is that my wife and I are blind and use gps 
for navigation. We run a program called loadstone-gps 
<A HREF="http://www.loadstone-gps.com/">http://www.loadstone-gps.com/</A> for navigation and finding bus stops.

I am happy to buy another gps unit for a time source but am trying not to 
use a bluetooth unit if possible since I don't really want the 2.4 ghz radio 
noise in the unit block and a cable seems more reliable potentially.

Any help or insight would be greatly apreciated. Happy to provide any debug 
dumps or similar information including switching gps to NMEA or similar.


Regards, Kerry.
