<PRE>Again, no show on the list 25hrs after sending
this post (see below).

Are all posts moderated and that explains the
delay?

&gt;&gt;<i> 5 by 5 here in New Zealand.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Must have been a backlog somewhere, perhaps here in the
</I>&gt;<i> Verizon E-mail system.  Several posts from the gpsdrive
</I>&gt;<i> popped up in my Inbox all at once!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt;&gt; Joerg Ostertag (gpsdrive Munich/Germany) wrote:
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; What we definitely cannot provide yet is real navigation.
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; We (GpsDrive) only have a moving map. But we're working
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; on getting Vectordata (from OSM) into gpsdrive. The first
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; Beta test where already successfull. This would (in the
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; long term) enable us to get Routing to your destination.
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; But it's a hard and long way. So if you're willing to join
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; us on this stony and difficult path, we'll definitely
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; welcome you here. Because every helping hand will be welcome.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I use Puppy Linux because the folks there have a similar
</I>&gt;<i> positive &quot;get it done&quot; attitude as yours and they have
</I>&gt;<i> drawn into the project lots of folks from around the
</I>&gt;<i> world.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It may be worth comunicating with the folks at Puppy
</I>&gt;<i> as I am certain they would love to have a GPS app as
</I>&gt;<i> part of the mix of resources for Puppy users.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Some things under Puppy work great, some things work OK,
</I>&gt;<i> and some things are under development.  There is constant
</I>&gt;<i> incremental improvement.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If I understand correctly gpsdrive will import free
</I>&gt;<i> maps downloaded from the Internet and display them
</I>&gt;<i> under Linux on a laptop.  Yes?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Also, you are saying that one must currently use an
</I>&gt;<i> Internet mapping program to determine the routing
</I>&gt;<i> and manually enter that into gpsdrive, then gpsdrive
</I>&gt;<i> would scroll the map as one actually followed that
</I>&gt;<i> routing?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> One *goal* is to be able to enter beginning and ending
</I>&gt;<i> points and have gpsdrive bring up the map and show the
</I>&gt;<i> routing?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Additional *extras* will be voice input and output
</I>&gt;<i> and a variety of other goodies?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; It does help if you have programming skills, but we
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; have more than enough things (from writing Documentation,
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; testing, collecting new tracks, proofreading, translating,
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; ...) which we would be very happy if we would get
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; help with.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I am best at breaking things!  :-)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What little programming and code troubleshooting and
</I>&gt;<i> patching I have done is many years ago, and even then
</I>&gt;<i> I was not trained nor very adept at it.  :-(
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I can help with documentation, testing, and proofreading.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I am not certain what &quot;collecting new tracks&quot; would
</I>&gt;<i> involve and am unfortunately typical of folks here in
</I>&gt;<i> the USA, I am mono-linguistic.  I have studied some
</I>&gt;<i> French and Spanish but did not use it and lost it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I could run non-English texts through the AltaVista
</I>&gt;<i> BabelFish app and clean them up on the English side.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I want to buy a Bluetooth GPS for gpsdrive but not if navigation is
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> unreliable.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; This heavily depends what you define as unreliable.
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; If you are located anywhere near Germany; I could borrow
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; one of my GPS for testing for some weeks to you. If
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; not someone else in your area might give you a helping
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; hand in borrowing you a GPS for testing this out.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I am about to buy one of the Cellink BTG-7000 Bluetooth
</I>&gt;<i> GPS devices.  Would that be a helpful device as part of
</I>&gt;<i> your development or would you prefer folks use USB devices?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> WDYT?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; I would decide by the following choices:
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; 1) If you need real Navigation with everything you can
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; imagine (Voice, on-the-fly rerouting, searching in a
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; streetname Database, ...) and you want to use it NOW.
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; You should definitely by one of these little Navigation
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; devices which can be used without extra testing and
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; installing around.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Right now I'd be happy with a scrolling map for the
</I>&gt;<i> USA, one that tells me where I am and one I may zoom
</I>&gt;<i> in for closer detail and out for the big picture.
</I>&gt;<i> Essentially an electronic map.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It would be good if I could enter a beginning and
</I>&gt;<i> ending address and have it bring up a routing map
</I>&gt;<i> but I understand that such a feature is under development
</I>&gt;<i> -- I can live without that feature for now as I almost
</I>&gt;<i> always begin at home or office where I can pull up a
</I>&gt;<i> route via the  <A HREF="http://ask.com">http://ask.com</A>  mapping resource.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; And if you want to contribute to GpsDrive or our
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; preferred upstream mapsource OSM (www.openstreetmap.org)
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; we would be really happy.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> No deep pockets here, thus the preference to help with
</I>&gt;<i> open source and the reluctance to spend hundreds on
</I>&gt;<i> commercial handheld GPS devices, but I will see what
</I>&gt;<i> I can do as far as a small contribution to both.
