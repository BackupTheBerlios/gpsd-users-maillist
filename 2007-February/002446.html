I tend to not bring up the issue of BSD-&gt;GPL or GPL-&gt;BSD switches;
authors will do so when and if it suits them. GPStk is primarily
developed by ARLUT - Advanced Research Labs: University of Texas - so
I'm guessing they've thought about the terms under which they release
their code and I suspect their lawyers agree. Personally, code that's
slightly encumbered by GPL is much more palatable than something
proprietary or unlicensed where some academic with no perspective
arbitrarily decides who he wants looking at his code... *grumble*

As for GPStk, it's GPL so it's free enough. It already has a standard,
well defined import interface: RINEX. That's why I indicated our
biggest milestone towards integration or interoperability with any
postprocessing tools is our (currently non-existent) ability to write
RINEX. I don't think we really need to agitiate for another interface,
or try to import their code wholesale. I'm not even sure its within
the scope of our project to do so. GPSD is all about getting the live
data out of an arbitary receiver - GPStk is about postprocessing.
Distinct, yet complimentary tasks to be handled by domain experts.

And for all my apparent anti-GPL venom, I don't have a problem with
it; I just don't want to mix licenses. I do keep abreast of GPStk's
changes, and send them patches. They seem like a reasonable bunch:
send them a change request (possibly with a diff) and a good
justification and they accept it. If a convincing case could be made
that switching GPL-&gt;BSD is in their benefit they may switch, but
that'd be a hard sell. Lawyers and technology transfer offices get
involved...
