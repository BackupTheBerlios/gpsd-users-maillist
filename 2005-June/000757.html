&gt;<i> Just tried a build of version 2.25 from the Debian package maintainer, and

Hm. I think svn head will do better, but I want to check.  Please send
a few K of NMEA output from the device -- ideally while it's moving.
Add a header as follows:

** Log files for regression testing

Any time you add support for a new GPS type, you should also send us a
representative log for your GPS.  This will help ensure that support
for your device is never broken in any gpsd release, because we will
run the full regression before we ship.

A logfile should consist of an identifying header followed by a
straight unencoded dump of GPS data, whether NMEA or binary. The
header should consist of text lines beginning with # and ending with LF.
Here is the beginning of one log file I already have:

# Name: Holux GM-210
# Cycle-time: 1-second
# Start-of-cycle: ?
# Pause-noted: ?
# Well-behaved: N
# Submitted-by: &quot;Patrick L. McGillan&quot; &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-users">pmcgillan at pateri.com</A>&gt;

The way to fill in the Name, Cycle-Time, Submitted-by, and Date
headers should be pretty obvious.  

Start-of-cycle should be the name of the NMEA sentence (or, in a
packet protocol, the numeric type ID of the packet) that is emitted
first in each cycle.

Pause-Noted should be Y or N as there is or is not a visible pause
between cycles.

Well-behaved should by Y if all sentences in the same cycle have the
same timestamp, N otherwise.

New log files should include after Date an additional Location header
giving the submitter's city, state/province, country code, and a rough
latitude/longitude.  A good one for the above file might look like
this:

Location: Osceola, Iowa, US, 41N93W

If you have notes or comments on the logfile or the GPS, or any
additional information you think might be helpful, add them as
additional # comments (not containing a colon) after these headers.
The test machinery that interprets the headers will ignore these and
any empty comment lines.

An ideal log file would include an initial portion during which the
GPS has no fix, a portion during which it has a fix but is stationary,
and a portion during which it is moving.

If your GPS is SiRF-based, it's easy to capture packets using the
'l' command.
