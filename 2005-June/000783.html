<PRE>I expect 2.26 to be a stable release that will be in use for some time.
Between the splint audit, the regression test suite, and Rob Janssen's 
salutary nagging :-), I am now much more confident about the code
quality than I have been.

With multisession and autoconfiguration now firmly in place, I
consider the daemon essentially feature-complete.  The one bit that
still needs to be filled in is computation of a track error estimate.
The main issue here is figuring out the applied mathematics.

Chris Kuethe, the SiRF firmware loader is now increasing in
importance. We're going to need to test new SiRF firmware versions, 
probably within months rather than years. 

Pursuant to Rob Janssen's last-minute suggestion, I audited the code
for MAXCHANNELS dependencies. I didn't change MAXCHANNELS to 16, as we
don't yet link any drivers that require this.  But I have done the
prep work -- there are now NMEA_CHANNELS, SIRF_CHANNELS and
ZODIAC_CHANNELS defines, used appropriately, which means that we can
set MAXCHANNELS to any value &gt;= 12 without breaking NMEA or packet
processing.  I have regression-tested MAXCHANNELS=16 and it works.

I consider the most serious item on the bug list to be Wojciech
Kazubski's report of a possible resource-exhaustion bug.  I think
we should attack this in at least two ways:

1) Dynamic auditing using valgrind, ccmalloc, or Electric Fence.

2) Build some test tools to script opening and closing multiple 
   sessions to the daemon and see if we can detect and reproduce
   a lockup.

If anybody on the list has experience with dynamic-auditing tools,
please step forward.  Does anyone know of tools for detecting fd
leaks?

I will be quite surprised if we can induce a lockup with
non-overlapping client sessions of one device at a time.  Multiple
devices and multiple sessions overlapping in odd ways is another
matter entirely -- getting deallocation right so as to prevent
memory or fd leaks is notoriously difficult in these circumstances,
and I wouldn't be astonished if we have bugs there.

I am also concerned about Rob Janssen's report of possible
state-machine lockups in the presence of heavy disk activity.  I will
attempt to reproduce this, but am not optimistic about doing so.

I expect Rob will be working on fixing the PPS code.  Odds are this
is a pthreads bug that will have to be worked around.

The known TSIP driver problems are annoying but can be lived with.
And that about does it for the bug list.

It is proper to take alarm at the first experiment on our
liberties. We hold this prudent jealousy to be the first duty of
citizens and one of the noblest characteristics of the late
Revolution. The freemen of America did not wait till usurped power had
strengthened itself by exercise and entangled the question in
precedents. They saw all the consequences in the principle, and they
avoided the consequences by denying the principle. We revere this
lesson too much ... to forget it	-- James Madison.
