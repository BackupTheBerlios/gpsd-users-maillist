<PRE>The svn head version of gpsfake has a new feature that supports
regression testing.  As usual, gpsfake spawns a gpsd instance, the GPS
log file on standard input input is fed to the master side of a pty
and the gpsd reads from the slave, so gpsds run exactly as though it
were looking at a real GPS (but will not set your system clock).

What's new is this: the new -p option makes it run through the logfile
exactly once, emitting W and R reports to standard output.  (In order
to do this, I implemented thread-callback support in gps.py.)

This is the basic tool we need for putting together a regression-test
suite for gpsd.  We can now collect a representative set of logfiles
from many GPSes, use gpsfake -p to crunch them into WR+ dumps, save
those, and regression-test the daemon by running gpsfake -p on each
log and checking whether it matches the saved version.

Therefore: send me a representative log for your GPS.  This will help
ensure that support for your device is never broken in any gpsd
release, because we will run the full regression before we ship.

A logfile should consist of an identifying header followed by a
straight unencoded dump of GPS data, whether NMEA or binary. The
header should consist of text lines beginning with # and ending with LF.
Here is the beginning of one log file I already have:

# Name: Holux GM-210
# Cycle-time: 1-second
# Start-of-cycle: ?
# Pause-noted: ?
# Well-behaved: N
# Submitted-by: &quot;Patrick L. McGillan&quot; &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-users">pmcgillan at pateri.com</A>&gt;

The Name, Cycle-Time, Submitted-by, and Date headers should be pretty
obvious.  

Start-of-cycle should be the name of the NMEA sentence (or, in a
packet protocol, the numeric type ID of the packet) that is emitted
first in each cycle.

Pause-Noted should be Y or N as there is or is not a visible pause
between cycles.

Well-behaved should by Y if all sentences in the same cycle have the
same timestamp, N otherwise.

New log files should include after Date an additional Location header
giving the submitter's city, state/province, country code, and a rough
latitude/longitude.  A good one for the above file might look like
this:

Location: Osceola, Iowa, US, 41N93W

(Patrick, please send me the missing fields if you can.)

If you have notes or comments on the logfile or the GPS, or any
additional information you think might be helpful, add them as
additional # comments (not containing a colon) after these headers.
The test machinery that interprets the headers will ignore these and
any empty comment lines.

An ideal log file would include an initial portion during which the
GPS has no fix, a portion during which it has a fix but is stationary,
and a portion during which it is moving.

Strict gun laws are about as effective as strict drug laws...It pains
me to say this, but the NRA seems to be right: The cities and states
that have the toughest gun laws have the most murder and mayhem.
