Plenty of other things (your dsl router, bios, raid card, etc.) can
take quite a while to flash. The industry consensus seems to be &quot;don't
reflash unless this fixes an unbearable problem, as the flash could
break things even worse. if something breaks, we warned you sucka!&quot;
And for the most part, the world is happy with that. Not that this is
a good thing, that's just how it looks to me.

I guess the feeling I'm getting is &quot;faster is better, but safety and
reliability are paramount.&quot; Which means no dawdling loading up code,
but no hackish shortcuts to unnecessarily save a millisecond. Gotcha.

&gt;<i> Both real concerns.

Ask me about my dead receivers from bad flashes. I thought I did it
right, but I was wrong. :( I need to win the lottery. Then I'll just
buy a crate of TN200's or a couple of development kits. :)

GDB has a 'break' feature; why doesn't it have 'fix' too?
