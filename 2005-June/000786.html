<PRE>I'm considering doing a 2.27 point release.  Changes since 2.26 have been
minor but include few bug fixes that users should get the benefit of.

Since 2.26 I have devoted most of my energy to Wojciech Kazubski's
report of a possible resource-exhaustion bug.  At the time I wrote
that I thought we should attack this in at least two ways:

1) Dynamic auditing using valgrind, ccmalloc, or Electric Fence.

2) Build some test tools to script opening and closing multiple 
   sessions to the daemon and see if we can detect and reproduce
   a lockup.

I have since done both these things.  The resulting greatly enhanced
test framework, and the Valgrind torture test written using it, are
now part of the distribution. The Valgrind audit found three bugs: (1)
a very slow memory leak on device deallocation, (2) a possible but
unconfirmed file-descriptor leak, and (3) a subtle error in the
channel-assignment logic that only showed up with multiple overlapping
sessions active.

As a result of these tests, I am now confident that the svn head code
has no dynamic-memory leaks.

Known or suspected bugs:

I remain concerned about Rob Janssen's report of possible
state-machine lockups in the presence of heavy disk activity.
He has also reported that xgps induces an X server memory leak,
but I instrumented for this and did not see it under FC3.

I expect Rob will be working on fixing the PPS code.  Odds are this
is a pthreads bug that will have to be worked around.

The known TSIP driver problems are still annoying but can still be lived with.

Features still needed:

Computation of a track error estimate.  The main issue here remains
figuring out the applied mathematics.

Chris Kuethe, I noted previously that the SiRF firmware loader is now
increasing in importance. We're going to need to test new SiRF
firmware versions, probably within months rather than years.


If you know of any urgent bugs or any other reason not to ship 2.27,
now would be a good time to tell me.
