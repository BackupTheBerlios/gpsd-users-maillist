generally yes. and more often than you'd think. on the first boot in a
while, the gps won't have a valid ephemeris, almanac or even estimate
of the time. it will have to cold start - this takes a while.
subsequent starts are faster. regardless of the freshness of the
aforementioned quantities most receivers tend to need 3-10dB more
signal for the initial acquisition than for tracking. there are ugly
tricks you can do in the firmware to reduce the difference between
minimum signal required to acquire and track, but they can have a
severe impact on solution accuracy.

that would be a crappy gps if you couldn't cold start in a forest.
maybe I'm just a receiver snob. :) alas, that's a pretty common
scenario, where you need to have better-than-average reception to
start tracking.

or sometimes you just have to wait a while for the receiver to
recalibrate the clock crystal - rockwell jupiter receivers are
infamous for having a multi-hour window where the crystal was being
calibrated and during that time you'd have a very hard time tracking
more than 3 PRNs. luckily this was only an issue after prolonged
periods without power. another thing to consider is multi-path;
reflections off buildings, solid objects, water, ... can all confuse
your receiver.

&gt;<i> When running gpsd without -n, it is going to have to get an initial fix
</I>&gt;<i> everytime?
</I>
-n is irrelevant to the issue of reception. this switch prevents gpsd
from closing the tty after identifying the device.

if the tty is closed, a usb-serial converter may enter a low-power
state... on any of my usb-powered receivers (itrax, ublox, sirf,
trimble) it a) doesn't save any useful amount of power, b) wastes my
time and c) doesn't interfere with the power provided to the GPS chip
itself. i'm very tempted to remove that switch.

my feeling is that unless your receiver is terribly broken it won't
matter whether any process has the tty open.

-- 
GDB has a 'break' feature; why doesn't it have 'fix' too?
