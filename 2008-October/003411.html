Nope. Just what I remember from back in the day when I was worked as
an engineer building bareboard GPS enabled satellite transmitters.
The acquire time was a very important consideration for us for power
reasons. if you only power up the GPS long enough to get a fix, after
some time the almanac is out of date but you're never on long enough to
get a new one. there's then a balance point between staying on for 1/2 hr
every now and then vs. living with it taking 45sec instead of 15 to get a
fix after things have drifted.

I am not sure if it's a handshaking issue, a change of data issue, or
simply a PITA to fill a circular buffer without making mistakes when you
don't know where you are until you reach the wrap point.

But we know that the almanac changes, and thus it is guaranteed that at
least some of the time packet != packet+1, and so you can't just graft
the blobs of two of them together and assume you have a valid packet.

e.g. if a new satellite is added does the length of the almanac grow or
shift some number of bits, or otherwise allow a graft to get corrupted?

I assume the thing has lots of checksums in it which may help, and
if someone was smart perhaps it even sends a packet ID at both the start
and end of each almanac, but I have no idea about the binary internals of
it.
