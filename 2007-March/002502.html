Oy.... this again! We've heard this happens, but have never got a good

How are you invoking gpsd? If it's not too much trouble, could you
perhaps add &quot;-N -D4&quot; to your gpsd command line and capture the ouput
with &quot;tee&quot; or &quot;script&quot;... I'd like to see what happens in the time
leading up to the gps going offline.

This could be a fairly large log, but so long as it's under 10MB,
compressed, you can send it directly to my email.

GDB has a 'break' feature; why doesn't it have 'fix' too?
