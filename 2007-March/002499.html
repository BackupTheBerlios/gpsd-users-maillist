<PRE>Hi All,

I've just spent the afternoon and evening attempting to get gpsd V2.34 to 
recognize PPS input from a Garmin 18LVC - but I haven't had much joy.

Using the following command line

	gpsd -n -N -D 5 /dev/ttyS1

I see the

	pps-detect  (DCD) on /dev/ttyS1 changed to 1
and
	pps-detect  (DCD) on /dev/ttyS1 changed to 0

messages in the debug info on the console. BUT, gpsd never accepts that the 
PPS signal is valid. Every occurrence of '.. changed to 0' is immediately 
followed by:

	PPS pulse rejected too short.

and various cycle &amp; duration values.

I've tried the following:

1. gpsd V2.34 via Gentoo ebuild (which required the ~x86 keyword as the 
package is still marked as testing in Gentoo).
This seems to be compiled with all GPSs enabled, PPS on DCD &amp; NTP support 
enabled. This was when I first noticed this issue, as ntpd would sync to 
the GPS refclock, but not to the PPS refclock.
Some investigation of sentences sent to the GPS showed that the unit was 
correctly being identified as a Garmin, baudrate was being set, and that 
the PPS pulse was being set to 100mS.
At this point I thought that maybe 100mS was too short for the hardware (a 
PIII 1GHz). It's not a particularly busy machine though - at the moment 
it's only running gpsd &amp; ntpd.

2. Checked out latest from SVN trunk.
Ran the autogen.sh script and then make. Rand gpsd - Same issue.

3. I then revisited my thoughts that the PPS pulse was too short, so I 
reconfigured gpsd with the --disable-reconfigure option &amp; recompiled. I 
then used the Garmin supplied windows program to change the PPS pulse width 
from 100mS to 500mS to 800mS, and finally right out to 940mS, testing 
against gpsd each time. Same results. The cycle and duration values in the 
log message do change to match the particular length of PPS pulse that the 
GPS was set to at the time.

4. According to an earlier post, Gary recommended changing the
	#define PUT_MAX_OFFSET        500000
in ntpshm.c to
	#define PUT_MAX_OFFSET        600000

I did this, recompiled gpsd and re-ran the tests that I did in trial 3, 
above. Still no joy....

BTW, I know that the PPS pulse is enabled, as I've watched it on my 
oscilloscope. Also, I doubt that I would be getting the lines in the debug 
output if it wasn't.


Any hints on what I've done wrong would be greatly appreciated. I KNOW that 
the 18LVC works as a PPS source as a number of people (including Gary) 
indicate that it's working well for them...... I just wish that it would 
work well for me!

Thanks, Dave
