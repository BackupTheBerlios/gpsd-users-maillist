<PRE>Chris just posted a patch implementing an -l option to change the
gpsd listener address, which is now 0.0.0.0 (accept connections on
any socket). 

Chris has made a strong privacy case that the default listener address
ought to be 127.0.0.1, so that your client has to be running on the same
machine that's hosting the GPS.  Those of you doing remote-telemetry things
would have to set a more promiscuous listener address.

I think the arguments for the ability to change this address, and the 
new default, are sound.  But this would be a significant user-visible 
change in behavior, so I'm posting well in advance of implementation
as an invitation to discussion and objections (if any).

Actually, I think the larger issue isn't whether to have this option 
but where to control it from.  I'm not happy with the idea of a
command-line option, for two reasons:

(1) It would be no help to most Linux users, for which gpsd is normally 
    launched by a hotplug script.  I'm dead-set against anything that would
    require users to edit that script.

(2) The expected lifetime of the administrator's choice about the listener 
    address doesn't match the time scope of a command-line option.  Making 
    it an entry in a /etc/gpsd.conf config file always read at gpsd startup 
    would be a better fit.

We also have the option of implementing a listener-address command
passed through the gpsd control socket, the way device-open
notifications are passed from the hotplug system now.  This would have
the same lifetime-mismatch problem as a command-line option.

We could put this option in an optional /etc/gpsd.conf config file.  But then
we'd have to write an interpreter for the config file syntax.  I dislike the
thought of adding that much complexity overhead.

However, while brainstorming with Chris on IRC I came up with a better
variation on this theme.  We've been talking for a while about
GPSD-NG, an extension of the GPSD command interpreter to support
commands more than one letter long.  We're going to need this to
support things like ephemeris and pseudorange queries.  The design
proposal is here: &lt;<A HREF="http://gpsd.berlios.de/hacking.html#protov4">http://gpsd.berlios.de/hacking.html#protov4</A>&gt;.

So.  Now, let's suppose that we implement &quot;listen-to&quot; as a protocol
command taking a listener-address argument.  Then, we add an option
(say, -c) that reads protocol commands from standard input at startup time.

Now, to get the effect of a config file, we invoke gpsd as 
&quot;gpsd -c &lt;/etc/gpsd.conf&quot; and we're done.  There's no separate
config-file interpreter; anything you can configure can be set 
via a normal session, and vice-versa.  Some configuration stuff,
including listen-to, would be gated by the existing code for 
recognizing privileged users.

If we go this route, some command-line options options that exist
now will probably be given the axe in favor of NG protocol commands.  
Instead of saying

	gpsd -S 1200 -b

you'll say something like 'echo &quot;!port=1200;noconfig;&quot; | gpsd -c'.

Again, since this would be a user-visible change, I'm posting well in
advance of implementation so it can be discussed and criticized.
