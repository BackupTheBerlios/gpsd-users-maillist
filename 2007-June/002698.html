<PRE>&gt;<i> If your Geode board has an IDE interface brought out, try using a Compact
</I>&gt;<i> Flash card as the boot device. A CF card (with the appropriate adapter)
</I>&gt;<i> will plug straight into the IDE bus and appears in Linux as /dev/hd&lt;x&gt;.
</I>
That's exactly what I am using.  Much nicer than a spinning HD.  It was
very easy to get deboostrap plonking a basic Ubuntu 7.04 onto it and have
ntp and gpsd packages installed using apt.

&gt;<i> also rate them down to -20C - and I've tested them in equipment in
</I>&gt;<i> Antarctica.....
</I>
Oh, well, it'll be living in a temp. controlled rack when it's done.

&gt;<i> Pretty much anything is better than w32time service......I've had issues
</I>&gt;<i> with it not wanting to synchronize against anything other than a Stratum 1
</I>&gt;<i> or Stratum 2 server...
</I>
It's dialing up a S1 server 4 times a day as it's on a private network but
the drift every 6 hours is 2 seconds which is no good.  Hence the
construction of a proper GPS based time server.  Saves about $4000 on
buying a commercial NTP/GPS server (and I get to learn something more than
just plugging in a power cord).

GPSOz were nice enough to make me a custom RV76 marine GPS antenna with a
15m sealed cable so I don't need to mess with extension leads running from
the roof to the server room.
