<PRE>Hi Jason,

My experiences with the Garmin 18 LVC (hopefully similar to the GPS15) are 
as follows:

1. Changing Baud rate will not change either the duration or frequency of 
the PPS pulse. The PPS pulse is a separate signal from the GPS engine, and 
only appears on the serial port  DCD or CTS lines as a convenience to get 
the signal into the PC.
The GPSD PPS code anachronously watches the serial port lines for signal 
changes and then acts on them (as if the code was doing hardware flow control).

2. I have had issues getting GPSD to get PPS lock on older machines (i.e. 
PIII 1000MHz) when I have a high level of debug enabled (i.e. -D5). I DON'T 
have problems on the same machine when I run with no debug enabled.
Don't know why - all I suspect that the latency of outputting the debug 
info to console is enough to disturb the PPS timing code. I haven't had 
time to prove this on a faster machine though.

3. If you have access to a windows box, try using the Garmin Configuration 
software to change the duration of the PPS pulse, and recompile GPSD to not 
do any configuration of the GPS, just in case GPSD is doing something funny 
in the configuration. It shoiuldn't be though - the Garmin code seems to be 
pretty tight.

4. Your description of your PPS interface circuitry sounds OK. Reading the 
datasheet I notice that the PPS pulse is 0V (low) and 3.3V (high). The 7404 
inverter is a strict TTL level device, with a Vhigh threshold of 2V minimum 
so you should be OK, although you might be better with one of the newer 
generations of 74 chips such as the 74HC series. Also note that the 7404 
datasheet notes that there is a maximum of 22ns delay when switching 
low-high and 15nS switching high-low. You will need to add this (and the 
delay through the MAX232) to your fudge factor in the NTP config file.

Your logic seems OK as well - a double inversion (7404 &amp; MAX232) should 
present the serial port with the PPS pulse in the same sense as the GPS.

Hope this helps a little.

ciao, Dave
