On my dev box, I unpacked a fresh copy of gpsd-2.34 and used the supplied
configure to do &quot;./configure --disable-python&quot; - no other options.

After configure finished, I looked in /usr/lib and found that python was
a symlink to the actual executable, python2.4 .  I changed the python
symlink to point to a short shell script that just echoed a line of
text.

I then ran &quot;make&quot; with no other options.  It got almost to the end and
then...

Hello, this is not python
make[1]: Leaving directory `/home/mroberds/gpsd/a/gpsd-2.34'
$

It appears that at this point, it really has built gpsd, so you're not
left hanging if you don't have Python.  But I agree that it shouldn't
even try to build the Python stuff if you've told it not to.

So, why was it still trying to build Python stuff?

The &quot;Hello...&quot; is from my shell script.

Looking at the setup.py that make was trying to feed to python, it
appears to be setting up for gpspacket.so .  gpspacket.c says it is
the &quot;Python binding for the packet.c module&quot;.  Digging around in the
Makefile, I _think_ these are the lines (from different parts of the
Makefile) that make it try to build gpspacket.so :

---
noinst_SCRIPTS = gpspacket.so setup.py
SCRIPTS = $(dist_bin_SCRIPTS) $(noinst_SCRIPTS)
all-am: Makefile $(LTLIBRARIES) $(PROGRAMS) $(SCRIPTS) $(MANS) \
   $(HEADERS) gpsd_config.h
---

The noinst_SCRIPTS is under a comment that says &quot;Build Python binding&quot;.
Looking in the Makefile some more, the Python stuff that did get shut
off successfully is commented out with '^#'.  Comparing to Makefile.in
shows that this is probably the result of a search-and-replace on
@HAVE_PYTHON_TRUE@ when creating Makefile from Makefile.in .

Armed with this information, I unpacked another fresh copy of gpsd-2.34 .
I added the @HAVE_PYTHON_TRUE@ symbol to the two lines under &quot;# Build
Python binding&quot; in Makefile.in, then ran &quot;./configure --disable-python&quot;
and &quot;make&quot;.  This time, it made gpsd without trying to fire up python:

---
gcc -g -O2 -Wall -Wcast-align -Wmissing-declarations -Wmissing-prototypes -Wstrict-prototypes -Wpointer-arith -Wreturn-type -D_GNU_SOURCE -o .libs/gpsd gpsd_dbus.o gpsd.o  ./.libs/libgps.so -lnsl -lm -lpthread
creating gpsd
make[1]: Leaving directory `/home/mroberds/gpsd/b/gpsd-2.34'
$
---

To see if I broke anything for the case when Python support is actually
wanted, I then ran &quot;./configure&quot; and &quot;make&quot; again.  It correctly tried
to fire up Python at the end of the make, and got my one-line shell
script.  I restored the symlink in /usr/lib and it fired up Python and
built gpspacket.so .  So, for a single test case, my proposed patch to
Makefile.in didn't hurt.

The proposed patch, against the Makefile.in shipped with 2.34, is:
