<PRE>Hi All,

I've run into a troublesome issue with gpsd and was wondering if anyone can 
explain what's happening (and the recommended steps to work around).

Background:

I have gpsd (v2.35b from SVN) running in the background on an embedded 
controller (PXA255 Gumstix) with a Garmin 18LVC GPS attached to ttyS3.

I have started gpsd with the -n option as I am using gpsd to supply ntpd 
with time sync info. This works OK, and holds the local clock to UTC +/- 1 
sec as I'm not using PPS. This is acceptable for my use at the moment.

I also have an Expect script that connects to gpsd every 10 minutes to take 
a position snapshot that is logged. This also works to my satisfaction.

The Problem:
As the Gumstix I'm using doesn't have a battery backed Real Time Clock, I 
cannot rely on the local clock to timestamp my GPS position data. Even 
though ntpd is running, a power cycle will reset the internal RTC to epoch 
(1 Jan 1970 or thereabouts), and 'ntpd -q -g' will take a while to pull in. 
So I thought that I would pull the date/time out of gpsd at the same time 
as I get the position data.

However, I notice that the date/time issued up by gpsd is exactly the 
date/time of the PREVIOUS position data. My logic is as follows:

connect to gpsd (telnet 127.0.0.1 2947)
Send D until response != GPSD,D=?
save GPS date
Send P until response != GPSD,P=?
save GPS position

If I telnet into gpsd and issue a D command manually, the first valid 
response is the time of the previous 'P' command. The second valid response 
is the correct time.

Can anyone enlighten me to what's happening here? It was my understanding 
that gpsd (if started with -n) should keep updating it's internal 
structures even if no client was connected. If this is a feature with 'D', 
is it also a feature with 'P'? Can't tell you if this is the case yet as 
the gear hasn't left my bench for a trial deployment.....

Thanks, Dave
