Overall I prefer the feel of &quot;-c filename&quot; for specifying a
configuration file. So +1 from me.

</I>
With regard to the listener address, the key issue was privacy. I get
the feeling that it would be better if the user had to actually do
something to announce his ICBM coordinates to the world. Transport
layer security for those who feel their location has value to a wider
audience is beyond the scope of this discussion. As you mentioned,
there are tools to ensure integrity in transit. Personally, I talk to
my machine over IPsec, but I could also use openvpn too.

I'm interested in implementing the RT-IGS protocol as an output
method. This is predicated on protocol v4, because we need ephemeris
and raw observations. From there, a client protocol will connect to
gpsd, pull out the raw observation message and reformat it as
appropriate. Looking at the specs, it doesn't appear that RT-IGS has
any confidentiality built in, and it doesn't look like they're after
tamper-resistance either; just error detection. www.rt-igs.net

GDB has a 'break' feature; why doesn't it have 'fix' too?
