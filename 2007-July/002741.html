I don't think the long bootup is the major source of your PPS trouble,
but: once you do start it up, how long have you left it on for?  Some
GPS receivers take a while to receive and store everything they need to
start again quickly, even after they've gotten a fix.  If possible,
power it up and leave it outside all day or all night, and see if that
improves the startup time.

</I>
I think it's unlikely, but possible.  Since you seem to know which end
of a soldering iron to hold, you could regulate down the +12 V from
inside your computer with something like an LM317 adjustable regulator,
a resistor, a pot, and a couple of caps, and put that question out of
the way very quickly.  Or you could even go buy some AAAs and install
them, but what's the fun in that?  :)

&gt;<i>   gpsd: Our duration is (244765447), must be atleast 80000 - 100100 to be a true pulse
</I>&gt;<i>   gpsd: PPS pulse rejected.  cycle: 200, duration: 244765447
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To me, that pulse duration is huge and doesn't even fit the ranges
</I>&gt;<i> the code it looking at for a 'true' pulse.
</I>
This looks to me like Dave C might be on the right track - you may need
one more inverter somewhere in the PPS line.  You may be able to rework
your level-shifting circuit to do it.

&gt;<i> You're the man, I'm going to definitely try hooking a jumper up tonight
</I>&gt;<i> (on both CTS and DCD) and see where that takes me.
</I>
This should show you pretty quick whether or not your serial port is up
to spec.  If you have access to another machine, or an older serial port
card with discrete hardware (not an all-in-one chip), you might see if
you can get better results from that.
