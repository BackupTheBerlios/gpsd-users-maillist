<PRE>Hi Chris,

&gt;<i>That makes sense. Until you ask gpsd for some data, i don't think it
</I>&gt;<i>fills in all the state. we do that because you could have multiple
</I>&gt;<i>devices, and you may want to use this, that or the other device.
</I>
You're right - that does make sense.

Maybe this is the same reason that the D command is returning old 
information the first time it is polled?

However, I thought that using the -n option on the command line kept gpsd 
connected to the GPS at all times? Although, it could be that again, gpsd 
isn't sure which device the particular client instance is interested in.

Would it not be better to present a D=? response the first time a client 
queries the time, rather than present (potentially) stale information?

I will try and see if this is also happening with the 'P' command. If it 
is, it could be a major problem in my application as I'm only waking up 
every 10 -30 minutes to get a fix, If the first fix is potentially old, 
then my spatial dataset will be out.

Thanks again for looking into this.

ciao, Dave
