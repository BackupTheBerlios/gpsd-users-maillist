<PRE>Matt, 

Quoting Matt Roberds &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-users">mattroberds at cox.net</A>&gt;:

&gt;<i> I suspect, though, that if you
</I>&gt;<i> can perceive the LED being on, the pulse length is almost surely longer
</I>&gt;<i> than 10 millisec.  I agree with Gary Miller that you should check to see
</I>&gt;<i> if your gpsd was compiled with pps support; if not or if you're not
</I>&gt;<i> sure, you may want to build it from source yourself.
</I>
`gpsd` is definitely compiled with PPS support.  I flip-flopped between builds
for DCD and CTS.  According to `gpsd`, I would get similar results if I used the
CTS PPS build or DCD build.  Below is the DCD build stuff.  I went code hacking
and really tore into libgpsd_core.c to see why I'm not tripping on any of the
PPS code.

So this is what I've gathered:

1)  My Deolorme Earthmate Serial GPS cold boot is crazy long.  We're talking
like 6-8 minutes before it gets a fix on any satellites and I start seeing NMEA
lines.  (Don't ask me why, it's made to take 4 AAA batteries (6 volts), but it
will take power in on pin 9 on the serial port (which is cool), so I've been
powering it via 5 volt USB soldering hack I fit in on my PPS circuit.  So lower
voltage causing the longer cold boot for satellite fixing?  Got me, man)

With that code boot so long, it initially checks and gets a handle on my PPS
pulse because I get this right away:

   gpsd: pps-detect (DCD) on /dev/ttyS0 changed to 0

But shortly after that, I get:

   gpsd: TIOCMIWAIT returns unchanged state, ppsmonitor terminates

Reason is does this is NOT because my pulse isn't there, it's because (IMHO and
and partly because of my cold boot GPS issue) of what is determined in the code
as a 'true' PPS.  The reason it cannot get my changed pulse state is because if
I don't get 4 valid fixes (according to the code, a Garmin specific standard)
then it's not a valid PPS.  Well if I don't ever make it to evaluating my pulse
duration part of the code because of the fix count, and the state unchanged
counter reaches its threshold (10 count), then it breaks out of the everlasting
loop to monitor the PPS, hence the &quot;ppsmonitor terminates&quot; message above and all
is lost.  (And I never see it try to enter that ppsmonitor code again, because I
have breakpoints all over it before it enters that everlasting loop I mentioned
above.)

...so obviously I rejiggered the code, so I could see what I was getting for a
pulse duration since that seemed like a good way to measure it feasibly and it
seems WAY too long (what Dave C has mentioned in his reply on this thread).
Below is my debug, you can see it'll loop up until that unchanged state
threshold (it's default is 10, I changed it way up to 50 to keep from breaking
out of the pps_monitor loop so quick):

   gpsd: Entering into the PPS status change DCD loop
   gpsd: The Fix Count in order to do pulse measurement is 3, ours is 0
   gpsd: Our fix count is 0, which is bigger than 3, continuing...
   gpsd: Our duration is (244765447), must be atleast 80000 - 100100 to be a
true pulse
   gpsd: PPS pulse rejected.  cycle: 200, duration: 244765447
   gpsd: Entering into the PPS status change DCD loop
   ...
   gpsd: Entering into the PPS status change DCD loop
   ... 
 
To me, that pulse duration is huge and doesn't even fit the ranges the code it
looking at for a 'true' pulse.  But I dunno, case in point:  Can I still have an
accurate NTP stratum-0 home-brew time server without PPS?  This seems like it's
going to be a miracle to get working... Is it possible my GPS is not a PPS
equipped receiver?  I dunno.  To Dave C.'s comment, perhaps I could not fanaggle
with this, and just set up NTP and see if `gpsd` will pick up my pulse signal.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't remember whether it's looking for a mark or a space on DCD.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
In the code it says it looks for the space duration.  Direct copy/paste out of
the code (good thing I looked in there ;-):  

    * ...The duration variable is used to
    * determine which way the pulse is going.  The code assumes
    * that the UTC second is changing when the signal has not
    * been changing for at least 800ms, i.e. it assumes the duty
    * cycle is at most 20%.
    *
    * Some GPS instead output a square wave that is 2Hz and each
    * edge denotes the start of a second.

&gt;<i> You could leave the GPS hooked up only to TXD, RXD, and ground, and
</I>&gt;<i> connect your own stuff (more in a minute) to the DCD pin.  Then fire up
</I>&gt;<i> gpsd in debug mode and apply known pulses to DCD to see if they show up
</I>&gt;<i> in the log.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The &quot;stuff&quot; you need is a way to apply something more positive than +3 V
</I>&gt;<i> or less than -3 V to the DCD pin.  This could be as simple as a jumper
</I>&gt;<i> that you could touch to either the +12 V or -12 V lines from the power
</I>&gt;<i> supply inside your computer (assuming a desktop), or a fresh 9 V battery
</I>&gt;<i> with snap connector.
</I>
You're the man, I'm going to definitely try hooking a jumper up tonight (on both
CTS and DCD) and see where that takes me.  I'm slowly losing faith that this is
going to work.

Thanks for everyone's insight on this.  Feel free to comment.

-Adam
