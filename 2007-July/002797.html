How I worked around the GPSD baud rate hunting problem. Perhaps usefull to
somebody experiencing the same problem.

No new GPSD has been released since my initial post so I tried again the
other day to find a fix/workaround for the problem. I got the GPS-500 with
Microsofts Street and Trips 2007 for Windows and the iGPS II Bluetooth
cradle as an accessory. That program will work only with NMEA at 4800 baud
and stopped working with the GPS-500 via BT as well as USB after using the
GPS-500 with GPSD. GPSD on Linux did not work with GPS-500 via BT and also
stopped working via USB. All that GPSD would do is baud rate hunt. Leaving
the GPS-500 useless to me.
After much experimentation I learned that GPSD (the default build) on its
own actually writes settings to the GPS-500 switching it to binary mode.
Surprise! So I wanted somehow to switch the GPS-500 back to NMEA at 4800 to
allow it to also work with S&amp;T. GPSD does support setting the GPS-500 to
NMEA mode on demand but did not work so I couldn't use it for that. Chicken
egg thing. And S&amp;T does not support writing to the gps device. Luckily a
program named SiRFDemo exist (and it's free). Using that I was able to
switch the GPS-500 back to NMEA at 4800 baud. I also discovered that GPSD
supports NOT writing to the GPS-500 but using only a build option. So I
rebuilt GPSD for that option using these commands

./configure --disable-sirf --disable-tsip --disable-fv18 --disable-tripmate
--disable-earthmate --disable-garmin --disable-evermore
--enable-fixed-port-speed=4800 --enable-dbus --disable-reconfigure
make
make install

With that I have now gotten MS S&amp;T on Windows and GPSD on Linux to work with
the GPS-500 via USB as well as BT and so far everytime.

Ought GPSD support &quot;--disable-reconfigure&quot; also as a run-time option?
