If you're on Linux, then the last time I looked, the kernel scheduler
ran at 100 Hz, or a 10 millisec interval, so pulses close to or shorter
than 10 millisec long might get missed.  I suspect, though, that if you
can perceive the LED being on, the pulse length is almost surely longer
than 10 millisec.  I agree with Gary Miller that you should check to see
if your gpsd was compiled with pps support; if not or if you're not
sure, you may want to build it from source yourself.

I don't remember whether it's looking for a mark or a space on DCD.
You could leave the GPS hooked up only to TXD, RXD, and ground, and
connect your own stuff (more in a minute) to the DCD pin.  Then fire up
gpsd in debug mode and apply known pulses to DCD to see if they show up
in the log.

The &quot;stuff&quot; you need is a way to apply something more positive than +3 V
or less than -3 V to the DCD pin.  This could be as simple as a jumper
that you could touch to either the +12 V or -12 V lines from the power
supply inside your computer (assuming a desktop), or a fresh 9 V battery
with snap connector.

With the jumper wire, you'd hook one end to DCD, then touch the other
end for about half a second (so you _know_ the pulse is long enough) to
+12 V, then leave the other end hanging for about half a second, then
touch the other end to +12 V again, and so on.  If that doesn't impress
gpsd, try the -12 V line.

With the 9 V battery, first plug the red wire into DCD, and touch the
black wire to ground - the metal shell of the serial port connector, or
one of the case screws - for about half a second, then leave it hanging
for about half a second, then touch it to ground again, and so on.  If
that doesn't impress gpsd, plug the black wire into DCD and touch the
red wire to ground.

Another way would be to plug in your GPS like normal, and use a terminal
program like Minicom to monitor the status of the serial port.  Or, use
a small utility like statserial (available as a Debian package, or get
the source from <A HREF="http://packages.qa.debian.org/s/statserial.html">http://packages.qa.debian.org/s/statserial.html</A> ) to
monitor the serial port.  If the DCD indicator in the program flickers,
then it's possible to detect the PPS signal on your hardware.  If this
software can't detect the PPS pulses from the GPS, see if it can detect
pulses from you, using a jumper wire or battery as above.  If nothing
works, maybe you're on the wrong pin, or your serial port is broken.  (I
found out the hard way that parallel ports don't really like to have
12 V AC applied to them...)
