<PRE>Adam,

What you described sounds like a potential bug I came across in the serial 
code for gpsd. I have been investigating this with another user, David 
Cottle, whilst trying to get his gps working with a new driver I am 
developing.

What we saw was that the 1pps on DCD was being tracked at the start of 
initialisation, but is lost somehow during the checks.

My feeling is that it is being killed by the baud scan routines, but I have 
not got all the evidence I need to formally say where/what the problem is.

We achieved success for Dave by modifying the way 1pps is initilised as a 
temporary work around.

Now that he is up and working (acting as my soak testing victim) I am about to 
start working on this 1pps fault in earnest. If/when I track it down, maybe 
it will help you.

I will probably need some help to fix this once I narrow it down a bit more as 
serial programming seems a bit of a black art.

BR

Mick Durkin
