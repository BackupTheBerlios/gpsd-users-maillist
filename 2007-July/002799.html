<PRE>Good morning,

I was successful in getting gpsd installed on my PC workstation.
Unfortunately, it's in my basement, so using it to test gps units
doesn't work very well. So I installed Ubuntu 7.04 on my Dell laptop
so I could go outdoors. Took me a bit to do that (vagaries of the
C400, I think) but I did get it setup and got gpsd and the clients
installed.

Tests with a couple of my gps units that have serial interfaces have
been successful, but I can't get anything to work using USB.
Occasionally, xgps gives me a satellite display that matches the gps
unit screen, but there is never any data transferred. Does the
satelitte info come from the gps unit?

I got gpsd and the clients from the links to the Debian packages on
the gpsd web site. They installed with no errors. I believe the
version of gpsd is 2.33.

My laptop is a Dell Latitude C400, 1.2G PIII, 512M RAM. I assume
that's enough computer to run this, since it's the only thing I have
running other than a web browser.

The GPS is a Garmin GPSMAP 60Cx which has both USB and a serial
interface. I also tested with a Garmin GPS V and a GPS III+ which have
only serial interfaces.

All of these worked the same with the serial interface. Using the xgps
tool, I could see accurate data that matched the gps display. No
amount of fiddling with the -s option would make the display 'stable'.
The clock updated in 2 second intervals, and the data lock alternately
 showed a fix and then no data. Setting -s from 0 to 10 had no effect.
I wasn't moving, so the velocity data was always n/a.

These three gps units have setup screens that allow configuration of
the com ports. In order to get anything, I have to set them to NMEA
in/out. The default GARMIN mode gets me nothing. On the 60Cx, with the
USB cable connected, the com port settings are ignored. At least that
what the screen seems to indicate.

So I need to get the USB connection working. Most of the gps units I
can test have only USB ports. Any guidance appreciated.

Also, is there a specific test sequence that is used to test a
particular gps. Is there some sequence of commands I should be using
and then capture the output?

Thanks!
