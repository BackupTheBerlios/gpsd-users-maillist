<PRE>Hiya.

I've had a few issues with PPS over the last 6 months.

My GPS: Garmin 18LVC

1. I found that I had issues getting gpsd to lock to the PPS when I had the 
gpsd debug level set to -D5 or greater. Admittedly, I was using a 1GHz PIII 
as the host processor, so what I think was happening was that the act of 
outputting the debug info was messing up the PPS timing loop. Turned the 
debug level down (or off) and I found that eventually ntpd would pick up 
the PPS signal from gpsd and all was happy.

2. Check your PPS interface circuit for signal inversion. You may find that 
instead of being too short, your PPS pulse may have been inverted and is 
now too long. (Yep, this got me too).

3. If you are still having issues with the DCD pin on your serial port, try 
using CTS instead. You will have to re-run configure with the 
--enable-pps-cts (check the help for exact option) and then recompile gpsd. 
It's a long shot, but will test if you've got a hardware issue on your 
serial port.

Hope this helps.

ciao, Dave

</I>&gt;<i>Right now with `gpsd`, it does a good job of auto-probing my GPS and does

</I>&gt;<i>pin on the serial port (pin 1), and I can see it happening, although I have no
</I>&gt;<i>real way to measure the pulse length or anything like that.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>But when I run `gpsd` in a really verbose debug mode (using -D6 flag) looking
</I>&gt;<i>for any &quot;pps&quot; signal lines that it's detected, I see nothing but gpsd probing
</I>&gt;<i>for my GPS type, then I see about 10 or 12 line so of this:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    gpsd:  packet sniff finds type -1
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>...then shortly after that, I start to see all the GP* type raw data lines
</I>&gt;<i>coming down.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>After some googling, I did come to realize that different GPS's may have a
</I>&gt;<i>shortened hardware pulse length that might not fit into the range that libgps
</I>&gt;<i>might have outlined? (note:  I haven't looked at libgps code at all, just
</I>&gt;<i>something I read)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I'm open to any suggestions or comments to track down why `gpsd` might not be
</I>&gt;<i>detecting PPS on the DCD pin on my GPS.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Thanks alot,
