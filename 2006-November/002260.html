<PRE>Hello all,
about 5 days ago I wanted to figure out if I would be able to connect my
new Garmin to gpsd via USB. I had gpsd 2.33.
(I already used it with gpsman, so the USB connection itself was ok)
I could see that gpsd somehow recognized my unit, but when checking with
gpsdrive or kismet, I never got any data position.

It looked as if gpsd wasn't able to fully understand the Garmin
protocol, so I decided it would be worthwhile trying the developer
version. I grabbed it with svn, compiled and I got further.

gpsdrive was able to gather the satellite view although signal strength
was errornously shown as 100% for all sattelites. But I coudln't get a
position either.

Hmmm... browsed through the mailing list archives, and by increasing
debug level gpsd was finally able to gather the actual position from my
unit. Error estimates were still missing, so it wasn't complete, but
there was some improvement.

Yesterday I updated my svn working copy, rebuilt, and huh? now gpsd
doesn't even recognize my Garmin anymore.

Is there any way in which I could help improve Garmin (USB) support?

Best regards,
Daniel
