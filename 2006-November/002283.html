<PRE>Chris Kuethe &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-users">chris.kuethe at gmail.com</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> yet another eye-candy generator. given 24 hrs of &quot;Y&quot; messages, this
</I>&gt;<i> tool produces a skyplot of accumulated signal strength. By way of
</I>&gt;<i> example, gpsd.mainframe.cx is on top of an office building, with
</I>&gt;<i> hardly any multipath to worry about. gpsd2.mainframe.cx is in an
</I>&gt;<i> office window, with buildings all around, so i have multipath and
</I>&gt;<i> obstructions. geographically, they're not that far apart.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Colour scheme: bright green for strong, dark green for good, yellow
</I>&gt;<i> for fair, red for weak. nothing if not tracking at all.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The tool is written in php and makes no attempt to be clever or
</I>&gt;<i> efficient; i just recycled a bunch of gpsd.php.

It makes pretty pictures.  And stimulates a couple of thoughts in my mind...

One:  As a fit-and-finish issue, I'm beginning to think we need a common set
of default visual conventions for our sky-views.  That is, somebody who has
seen xgps should be able to interpret output from these PHP scripts at
a glance and vice-versa.  When the GNOME client comes in, its defaults
should look the same way.  

In each case, there could be other presentations -- I don't want to
step on anyone's creativity or prevent experiments that might lead us
to a better set of conventions -- but the *defaults* should look
the same.

I mostly like Chris's conventions -- actually, I like them better than
my own attempts to pack more information into the xgps skyview.  As a
start, I suppose I should fix xgps.c to use them.  One change I would
like to see is WAAS/EGNOS satellites rendered in a different shape; a
little diamond or square would be my first choice.  Right now we're
using color to convey two different kinds of information -- signal
strength and satellite type -- which is just generally bad practice in a
UI like this.

Two: I think this script crosses a line I had hoped nobody would push
for a while.  Maintenance problems rise with the square of the number
of languages in the package, and I was serious about trying to hold us
to C and Python.  I took Chris's gpsd.php script because it's fairly
hard to argue with PHP for live web pages, but I was a little uneasy
about it because I feared opening the floodgates to anyone's favorite
special-purpose language.

So, what happens next?  Chris, the clever bastard, materializes some
code that is a near-perfect argument for accepting PHP as a main
language for the data-analysis tools.  I look at it, and while the right
hemisphere of my brain goes &quot;Oooh, *shiny*...&quot; the left hemisphere
is screaming &quot;Nooooo!  No more languages!&quot;

We've got more than you'd think.   To be a competent maintainer for
the entire project one should need to be able to at least limp along
in all of C, C++, Python, shell, PHP, and gnuplot.

So, even though half my brain is still going &quot;Oooh, shiny!&quot; I think
I have to say nyet, this at most goes into the contrib directory as
unsupported.  As a to-do item, we might add translating this into
Python that generates gnuplot, the way gpsprof does.
