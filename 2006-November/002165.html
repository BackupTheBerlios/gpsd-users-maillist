<PRE>I'm back from my friend Beth Matuszek's wedding in Austin.  The bride
looked radiant, the groom managed to stumble through his lines, and I
made the sacred pilgrimage to Rudy's -- which advertises &quot;the worst
barbeque in Texas&quot; and in so doing LIES THROUGH ITS *TEETH*.  Not to
be missed if you're visiting.  Meanwhile:

1. The Garmin serial driver is busted.  There is more than one report 
that it works at -D6, but not with debugging set any lower.  I've suggested
to Gary that he put some sleeps alongside the debug statements.

2. Chris needs to tweak the E response so it ships &quot;?&quot; for data not present.
(Chris, please don't forget to fix gpsd(8) while you're at it.)

3. The True North driver is broken, and we seem to be dead-ended on
finding a fix.  I don't think this bug is a deep one, it just need
someone with both C skills and their hands on test hardware.  I have
reached a real human at True North Technologies and we may be able to
get an eval unit.

4. gpsctrl is still a work in progress.  It can reliably switch SiRF
binary to NMEA but is having trouble recognizing SiRF NMEA.  This may be
addressed by the next item.

5. While in Austin, I had a thought about how to make NMEA dialect 
recognition more reliable.  Some devices, like the Garmin GPS-10, don't
like being hit with a bunch of probe strings in succession.  So I 
think I'm going to write logic to allow enqueing the probe strings and
shipping each one between successive packet receives until the queue
empties.  That way the GPS will only see one probe before having time to
respond, and we'll avoid overrunning whatever internal receive buffer
it uses.

6. Mick Durkin has contributed an impressive tutorial on how to write
a gpsd driver.  I plan to put it on the project website this evening.
