<PRE>Another good launch today - the third Block IIR-M (Generation 2,
Replenishment, Modernized).

It seems the Air Force has learned a lot in the last year. They took
their sweet time (3 months) space-qualifying the first one (SVN53),
and understandably so. On-orbit verification of a new platform is no
small task. Still, I got a new gps *satellite* for Christmas!

A year later the second (SVN52) went up, no doubt with a whole bunch
of patches, bug fixes and case mods. As they've had a year to design a
test suite, this bird took less than 3 weeks to check out.

With everyone still wearing their &quot;rocket man&quot; hats, SVN58 was
launched after being delayed yesterday by weather. It wouldn't
surprise me if this one was activated sometime in the first week of
December, though official estimates are for &quot;mid-December&quot;.

The Control Segment is to be congratulated for their expert management
of the Space Segment; many of the satellites are still functional at
twice their design lifetime. Still, there are compelling reasons to
upgrade: more efficient transmitters, higher-stability clocks, more
powerful and robust onboard computers, support for new civilian
signals...

GDB has a 'break' feature; why doesn't it have 'fix' too?
