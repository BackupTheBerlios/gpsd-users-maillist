<PRE>Matt Roberds &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-users">mattroberds at cox.net</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> This is perhaps a little far afield from GPS software development, but
</I>&gt;<i> here goes...
</I>
That's OK.  I'm having a learning experience.  Persons who object to this
will be told to get stuffed.  Persons who do not object will be entertained by
the vaguely Dave-Barryesque clowning that I employ as thin cover over 
my atavistic terror of burning up Really Expensive Equipment.  (You
see, electronics and computers really was Really Expensive Equipment in
my formative years when dinosaurs roamed the earth -- that would have
been the early 1970s).
 
&gt;<i> Micronta == Radio Shack.  For all their many failings, Radio Shack is
</I>&gt;<i> fairly good about having manuals for older products online.  The model
</I>&gt;<i> number will be either on the face of the meter or on a sticker on the
</I>&gt;<i> back and will probably be of the form 22-[0-9][0-9][0-9] .  Put that
</I>&gt;<i> model number in the search box at radioshack.com and you'll probably get
</I>&gt;<i> a PDF of the manual.
</I>
22-211.  No match; I guess it's too old.
 
&gt;<i> &gt;OUTPUT                             +DC1200
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;AC 1200V                           +DC 600V
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;-COM (500V Max ground)             +V - Ohms - A
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Most of the time you will have the black one plugged into -COM and the
</I>&gt;<i> red one plugged into +V - Omega - A.  You might plug the red one into
</I>&gt;<i> AC 1200V, +DC1200, or +DC 600V if you are measuring really high
</I>&gt;<i> voltages.
</I>
That is enlightening.  I had thought they were arranged in horizontal pairs.
 
&gt;<i> The (500V Max ground) on -COM means that the -COM terminal shouldn't be
</I>&gt;<i> more than 500 V above earth potential.  In practice it will be hard for
</I>&gt;<i> a mild-mannered computer hacker to exceed this, as long as he stays out
</I>&gt;<i> of microwave ovens, CRT monitors and TVs, and the circuit breaker panels
</I>&gt;<i> at a commercial office building or factory.
</I>
I'd actually figured out that part and the unlikelihood that I'd exceed 
it unless I took apart a CRT.  Which I won't do -- I'm only ignorant, not 
suicidally stupid.

&gt;<i> Basically, you want to select range = ceil(expected_input).  The 3 V
</I>&gt;<i> range would be OK for an alkaline cell (1.5 V or less) but won't work
</I>&gt;<i> very well on a 5 V power supply.  The 15 V range would be better for the
</I>&gt;<i> 5 V supply.  The 60 V range would also work, but it'll be pretty hard to
</I>&gt;<i> tell the difference between 5 V and 10 V, since it'll all be squished
</I>&gt;<i> down in one end of the range.  If expected_input is unknown, you start
</I>&gt;<i> at the highest range and work down.
</I>
In fact, I managed to figure this out and measure 6 volts in the 15-volt range.

&gt;<i> The other part of using an analog meter is figuring out which of the
</I>&gt;<i> several parallel scales to read.
</I>
That part was easy.  The upper bounds on the 4 scales under DC are the numbers
on the mode wheel.  Like I said, I'm only ignorant, not stupid.

&gt;<i> &gt;Gadzooks.  I actually understood that!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There's nothing more dangerous than a programmer with a screwdriver.  :)
</I>
Easy.  Manager with a design idea :-).
