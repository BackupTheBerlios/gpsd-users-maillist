That's good to know. I have bought the small Version and then got told Network 
connections only work with the big Version. Since the menu for network 
connections can be seen even in the small version. But my mail on how to 
upgrade was never answered. So now I have two GPS-receivers on my car. One 
for gpsdrive(with gpsd) and one for Directions. 
B.t.w. If someone would get MapSource running under wine I'd then have to add 
another receiver ;-)
