<PRE>I meant to send my take on this to gpsd-users too.

&gt;<i> Who handles the funds?

Eric, for now, as he signed up for the account and is running the project.

&gt;<i> Who gets all the toys?
</I>
People who can write code with the toys. Though they're not commiters
(yet?) I wouldn't have a problem sending money/toys to folks like Petr
Slansky or Mick Durkin. They've both written drivers and contributed
valuable bug reports and patches - they've shown that they can hack
it, so to speak.

Loaner units are not a good idea. It's expensive and inconvenient to
keep shipping units back and forth every time a test is required. New
code can often break old code; there are plenty of exables in the
archives where one of us commits something and then a commit goes in
two minutes later to fix that. Ongoing regression testing is required.

I hope this doesn't come across as bitter, but I've spent around $500
on stuff for gpsd - no one made me do it, I just find that this is an
interesting field to play in, and much like automobile racing, it can
be an expensive hobby.
- I bought a copy of the RTCM104 standard so that one of us could
authoritatively answer RTCM questions. I'm not allowed to give out
copies, but I can answer reasonable questions.
- I've got a couple of Antaris receivers on the way so I can work on
UBX, raw measurement and maybe PPS support.
- Not that long ago I got a receiver based on the iTrax03 so I could
start in on iTralk and raw measurement support.
- I've got a Trimble Lassen iQ (just waiting on the interface board)
so that I can check that TSIP still works (tsip and garmin look a lot
alike) and also work on raw measurements.
- I got a SiRFstarIII receiver so that I could make sure gpsd still
did the Right Thing.

&gt;<i> The books need to be open.
</I>&gt;<i> (at least to those with commit rights- IMO it only needs to be fully
</I>&gt;<i> disclosed &amp; public if you go the paypal cash solicitation route)
</I>
AdSense revenue is a black box - Google does not disclose their exact
payouts. We hope that this will make us enough money to keep up with
the latest receiver types. If someone wanted to send enough money to
buy a receiver, I'd say &quot;just send the receiver&quot;. Still, I'd have no
problem accounting for my use of project funds, if there were project
funds. It would be even better if vendors just started sending us
samples or full eval kits...

Real World Example: very so often OpenBSD puts out a call for funds
for a specific... task, I guess. The last one was to raise money to
buy a specific model of Thinkpad for ACPI development. I'm not sure of
the exact accounting procedure - I'm guess one of the developers just
keeps track of the money and says stop when there's enough for the
task at hand. Excess probably goes into the project's general coffers
to be disbursed to further the project's aims. Those who've donated
money, goods or services to OpenBSD are credited on an acknowledgement
page.

GDB has a 'break' feature; why doesn't it have 'fix' too?
