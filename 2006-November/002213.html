Thats one of the reasons I decided against purchasing Directions Ltd's
Navigator 4.4 for Linux. I e-mailed them when version 4 came out, and
asked if they supported gps connectivity via GPSD, and if not, would
they implement that functionality, since GPSD can be considered the
standardized way of connecting gps's to a linux box. They replied in
the negative.
It also looks like they are dropping support for Linux in their new
version due on the 11'th of november. WinXP only.

Incidentally, if people need to connect several applications to one
GPS under WindowsXP, there are two solutions I can recommend.
Payware - get Franson's GPSGATE.
Freeware - get Xport3.
The first solution has several bells and whistles including native
Garmin USB, native Garmin Binary support and optional translation from
Garmin binary to NMEA on a per virtual port basis. I.E. Run Garmin
mapsource on one port with Garmin Binary, and any other NMEA
compatible app on other ports from the same Garmin device.
The second solution has a small footprint, and does just whats needed
- virtualize one comport into upto 8 virtual comports.

If you long for some of the functionality GPSD provides for Linux,
under WindowsXP, these two apps can provide a pseudo similar
functionality.
