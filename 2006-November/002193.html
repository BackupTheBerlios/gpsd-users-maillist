<PRE>&gt;<i> &gt; You want to extract good tech details?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Work on your skills as a salesman.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> No offense, Hamish, but unless your salesmanship skills are rather
</I>&gt;<i> above average for a techie I'd say Chris is ahead of you on this one.
</I>

None taken, I didn't mean that to be a flippant comment at all -- I am
quite serious, it's a valuable thing for a tech to study. I am sorry if
in my brevity it came off a bit rude.

I have in fact worked professionally for almost 18 yrs as a tech on many
projects (incl oem gps industry), and spent a silly amount of time
working the phone lines with manufacturers. In that time I have worked
with some techs who were absolute master salesmen on the phone. It was
honestly amazing the results they could get, even from monsters like
Motorola. Samples, interface docs, you name it- and by FedEx. I don't
doubt for a minute that Chris has put in a better effort than I could
have, but &quot;they won't talk to us without a million dollar order&quot; is
wrong. Once they have your money a company's interest goes as far as
holding on to a good customer. What really gets action is the lure of
another 10,000 unit sales, and it costs you nothing to place that spark
in the mind of the rep at the other end of the phone (this is quite
easy- you'll make their day by having the potential sale come to them).
Consider who is more important in the average company: the VP of sales
or the VP of support? Then you get the phone number of the &quot;right&quot; devel
&amp; a decree that they should talk to you, get the devel interested in
your problem from whatever angle motivates them, and off you go. I have
seen this successfully executed time and time again.. I am trying to
encourage y'all that the corporate wall is perhaps not as high as you
might think, keep trying.

  ... but back to work now.


warmest regards &amp; best of luck with Garmin,

Hamish
