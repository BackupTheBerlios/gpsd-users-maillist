*sigh*...

On to better things, Eric deserves kudos for the &quot;For Vendors&quot; page.
It's a slightly longer and significantly less ad-hoc version of the
speech I've given to SiRF and Fastrax and Navsync when I asked for,
and received answers. I have no doubt that it will be effective.

Within 2 business days of sending SiRF and Fastrax an email explaining
what I would like, what I'm going to do with it, and why this is good
for them I received my answers either directly from one of the
executives or cc'd to the exec showing that my request had been
fulfilled. With Navsync I went through sales, and it took a little
longer, but I did get my answers.

I've repeatedly made similar efforts to gain inroads at Garmin, and
have always been denied.  I've got as far as their senior avionics
engineer. I give up. Lucky for me (and bad for Garmin) that all the
receivers easily that do what I'm after are affordable and non-Garmin.

GDB has a 'break' feature; why doesn't it have 'fix' too?
