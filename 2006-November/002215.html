<PRE>Chris Kuethe solved Petr Slansky's crash bug.  My fault, I'm afraid;
I missed an edge case when I coded up the little function for reporting 
GPS type with subtype.

I've got the Axiom Sandpiper II working.  No trip to Radio Shack was needed,
turns out the power supply from one of my old dead Linksys routers is
physically and electrically compatible.  

The only web source for Axiom Sandpiper II documentation is exhibits
attached to an eBay auction which could terminate at any time.  Last
night I gathered up all that stuff, cleaned most of the Microsoft goo
out of it and put it on the project website.  

I still don't know why the Sandpiper doesn't respond to the normal
SiRF probe.  I'm thinking today I'll add a type-forcing option to
gpsctl, see if I can flip the Sandpiper into SiRF binary, and query
the firmware version.  I'll bet it's pretty old.

Remaining issues in priority order:

1. Garmin USB driver using mode 1 (serial emulation) is still busted.  

2. PPS support is still broken.  Gary is working on this.

3. The biz-dev director at True North Technologies emailed me to say
he's &quot;noodling&quot; our request for cooperation.  I sent him to the new
web page for vendors.

4. I still have an off-list conversation going with Davor Emard that may 
lead to working GPS-10 support and some minor robustness improvements.

5. Once Gary fixes his timing problem in the driver, garminctl needs 
to be merged into gpsctl.

We're very close to that oh-so-elusive condition of release readiness.
Gary, are you going to be able to give your issues any concentrated 
attention in the near future?
