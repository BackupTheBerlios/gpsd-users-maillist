<PRE>Carl Brown &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-users">cbsled at verizon.net</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> Another possible scenario would be to keep gpsd at simple PVT, and fork the 
</I>&gt;<i> project with a &quot;navd&quot; or so branch that would be intended to handle all known
</I>&gt;<i> NMEA sentences. Users with simple needs would be better served by a 
</I>&gt;<i> non-bloated gpsd, while the advanced stuff would be available for those who 
</I>&gt;<i> need it.
</I>
The amount of code duplication this &quot;branch&quot; approach implies makes me
really unhappy.

I think the goal you're suggesting would be better served by extending the
current approach -- write an all-singing, all-dancing service library and
then write multiple policy front ends that don't necessarily link all of it.
Then make it possible to selectively condition device types out of the libary.

One of the things I've been thinking about recently is how to make it possible
for device drivers to register extended-NMEA setentence handlers rather than
having them all live in nmea_parse.c.  If we get that right, humminbird.c will
declare its bathymetry sentences and the TNT its compass-heading sentences
only if the driver is actually linked.

You should study the way gpsd.c, which is the policy frontend in the
daemon, plugs into the libgpsd(3) library, which is essentially the
entire rest of the daemon.  I spent a *lot* of effort on getting the
layer separation right.  The evidence that I succeeded is that gpsctl
was easy to write.

&gt;<i> While we're on the subject of planning...
</I>&gt;<i> NMEA 2000 will be coming soon to a system near you, just to make things more 
</I>&gt;<i> interesting. &lt;<A HREF="http://www.nmea.org/pub/2000/index.html">http://www.nmea.org/pub/2000/index.html</A>&gt;
</I>
I've read about it.  It looks like all the changes are physical- and 
transport-layer upgrades that, dammit, won't fix any of the problems
in the protocol design.
