No idea about linksys ones, but in general probably &quot;not really&quot;.
The wall wart is a black box with an AC wall plug on one side, and DC
adapter on the other. What is inside will vary as much as black boxes.
Commonly they aren't well regulated (or any more than they need to be),
but under small loads it shouldn't be too critical if they aren't.


&gt;<i> I wonder about this because the Sandpiper seems completely happy with 
</I>&gt;<i> the power it's getting -- I've seen no data dropouts or resets or any
</I>&gt;<i> other strange behavior tha might indicate it's getting voltage
</I>&gt;<i> variations  it dislikes.
</I>
in that case I'd happily not worry about it until I get problems.
(that is if the input voltage is nominally correct- if you are running
higher than the asked-for voltage you take your chances of frying it)

 
&gt;<i> So either the Sandpiper is more tolerant of voltage variations than
</I>&gt;<i> the spec sheets let on, or the wall wart is delivering regulated
</I>&gt;<i> power, or my mains power is unusually clean.
</I>
or it's unregulated and the sandpiper doesn't suck very much power, so
the voltage never drops enough to be a problem. we have no way of
knowing. In practice it is best to obey the spec sheets, and count
anything you can get away with beyond that as luck.

 
&gt;<i> Or...hm...the wall wart is actually plugged into the UPS that runs 
</I>&gt;<i> my computer.  Could it be that whatever power smoothing the UPS is
</I>&gt;<i> doing is making regulation in the wall wart unnecessary?
</I>
while the DC lead-acid batt can act like a massive capacitor, your UPS
puts out AC; it won't stop noise (unless you have some crazy $$ milspec
UPS or something). All the voltage regulation action is happening within
the DC adapter.

Maybe in places with unstable power you get a UPS which acts as a surge
suppressor too? I'm no expert on them.

&quot;Regulated&quot; isn't per se referring to smooth &amp; noise-free DC output
(although that's important too), it is more guaranteeing that the
voltage doesn't drift out of the specified range. (you hit it with a
load, it holds strong at 5.0v and doesn't dip)


&gt;<i> E.g. should I add a warning in my Axiom notes that the wall-wart hack
</I>&gt;<i> might fail if it isn't downstream of an UPS? 
</I>
no. a) it probably isn't correct  b) it is preferable not to report wild
guesses as fact in the man pages (casts suspicion on every other part of
the project if it sets off the reader's baloney-meter). better to
rephrase it as something like &quot;we've had luck powering the thing with a 
linksys DC adapter we found lying around, although this may blow yours
up. good luck.&quot;
