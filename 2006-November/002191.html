<PRE>There's a bug in our to-do list that reads:

*** Axiom Sandpiper II OEM NMEA GPS Module gets mistaken for an FV-18

David Mandala &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-users">davidm at them.com</A>&gt; reported this bug.  He says it can 
be worked around by setting the port to 4800 manually before starting
GPSD.  David sent ESR one of these, it's somewhere in his piles of
stuff, testing will get done when it surfaces.  More on the Sandpiper
at &lt;<A HREF="http://www.allsurplus.net/Axiom/">http://www.allsurplus.net/Axiom/</A>&gt;.


I found the Axiom Sandpiper this evening, but being ignorant of
electronics I have only the vaguest clue what to do to make it work.
What I have is two pieces:

(1) a black box with a DB9 cable coming out of it, which I presume to be the
GPS, and

(2) a thing marked GPS/AMPS/1900 Combo Antenna with two skinny cables 
running from it; cable ends are labeled AMPS and GPS. 

The package also contains a piece of pink notepaper that says: 
&quot;Regulated 5VDC Positive Center&quot; and some spec sheets that look to
have been printed from &lt;<A HREF="http://www.allsurplus.net/Axiom/">http://www.allsurplus.net/Axiom/</A>&gt;.

The cable end labeled &quot;AMPS&quot; mates to a screw connector on the black box.
The black box has a second connector of a kind I've never seen before.
It's a sort of male screw connector about 0.25&quot; wide with a fat metal post 
in a well off-center in it.

I'm gathering this is a 5-volt power connector, and that the other
cable from the antenna is a power connector as well.  Where I am
completely lacking any idea is what to mate these power cables to.

Where do I go to buy a &quot;Regulated 5VDC Positive Center&quot; power supply?
Are they likely to have them at the local Radio Shack?

Clueless in Malvern...
