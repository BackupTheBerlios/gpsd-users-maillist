<PRE>My apologies for the lack of correct follow-up headers; I am a new
subscriber.

Probably.

&gt;<i>(2) a thing marked GPS/AMPS/1900 Combo Antenna with two skinny cables
</I>&gt;<i>running from it; cable ends are labeled AMPS and GPS.
</I>
AMPS is Advanced Mobile Phone Service, better known as the first
generation of &quot;cell phones&quot; that became popular starting in the
mid-1980s or so in the US.  I think the &quot;1900&quot; refers to the 1900 MHz
frequency of newer (GSM?) mobile phones but I'm not sure.  Anyway, this
antenna is probably designed to let you run a mobile phone and a GPS in
a vehicle, but should work fine for stationary use as well.  The &quot;AMPS&quot;
cable will be connected to the AMPS and presumably the &quot;1900&quot; antennae;
the &quot;GPS&quot; connector will be connected to the GPS antenna.

&gt;<i>The package also contains a piece of pink notepaper that says:
</I>&gt;<i>&quot;Regulated 5VDC Positive Center&quot; and some spec sheets that look to
</I>&gt;<i>have been printed from &lt;<A HREF="http://www.allsurplus.net/Axiom/">http://www.allsurplus.net/Axiom/</A>&gt;.
</I>
&quot;Positive center&quot; is usually associated with the small barrel plugs used
to connect wall-mounted power supplies to all manner of small electronic
devices.  You may have seen glyphs resembling these on the power
supplies or the devices:

+ ---o)--- -

- ---o)--- +

The first one is positive center (aka positive tip or tip positive) and
the second one is negative center.

&gt;<i>The cable end labeled &quot;AMPS&quot; mates to a screw connector on the black
</I>&gt;<i>box.
</I>
If the black box is indeed the GPS, connecting the &quot;AMPS&quot; cable here
probably won't do you any good.  You probably need to get the cable
labeled &quot;GPS&quot; connected to the black box.  You can buy adapters to mate
various coaxial connector types, but probably not at Radio Shack.

&gt;<i>The black box has a second connector of a kind I've never seen before.
</I>&gt;<i>It's a sort of male screw connector about 0.25&quot; wide with a fat metal
</I>&gt;<i>post in a well off-center in it.
</I>
Does it resemble the gold-colored connector at the top right of the
circuit board at <A HREF="http://www.allsurplus.net/Axiom/">http://www.allsurplus.net/Axiom/</A> or is it different?
It might be the DC power connector.  It's probably more common for
the visible part of a DC power connector to be a circular well with
a pin in the middle, but there are some where you see a a roughly
D-shaped well with the pin a bit off-center and a flat metal contact
along one side.
<A HREF="http://www.packetradio.com/catalog/images/products/DCJ-4_small.jpg">http://www.packetradio.com/catalog/images/products/DCJ-4_small.jpg</A> is in
the direction of what I'm talking about;
<A HREF="http://www.mouser.com/catalog/specsheets/KC-300123.pdf">http://www.mouser.com/catalog/specsheets/KC-300123.pdf</A> has a line
drawing of what I'm thinking of.

&gt;<i>I'm gathering this is a 5-volt power connector, and that the other
</I>&gt;<i>cable from the antenna is a power connector as well.
</I>
The other antenna cable is probably for a mobile phone, as above.
Quite often, a GPS antenna will both get power for its internal
amplifier and send the signal it's picked up over the same coaxial
cable - you just hook up one connector to the receiver and it's ready
to go.

&gt;<i>Where do I go to buy a &quot;Regulated 5VDC Positive Center&quot; power supply?
</I>&gt;<i>Are they likely to have them at the local Radio Shack?
</I>
Maybe.  4.5 V and 6 V supplies are more common; a 4.5 V unregulated
supply might have enough voltage to work, or it might have way too much
voltage and cook the GPS.  They might have a &quot;digital camera&quot; regulated
power supply with a 5 V output that should work, but expect to pay a
silly amount of money ($30+) for it.  A better price is $15 new or $5-
$10 from a surplus house.

You already own a nice 5 V regulated supply; there are 5 V lines on USB
and PS/2 ports and of course on the disk drive power connectors inside
a desktop PC.  Making this work will however require terrifying surgery
on cables.

Another alternative is to buy a holder for 4 AA cells in series (this is
something you _can_ get at Radio Shack) and install 4 freshly-charged
NiCd or NiMH rechargeable batteries.  This will give you about 4.8 V,
which should run the GPS - if it doesn't, it most likely won't damage
the GPS, it just won't work.  Three alkalines (4.5 V) may or may not
work, but again are unlikely to cause damage.  Four alkalines (6 V) are
too many.  The cell holder will just have wires coming off of it; you'll
have to do cable surgery or soldering to install a suitable plug to mate
with the GPS.

You may need to find a local electronics distributor (_not_ Radio Shack,
Circuit City, etc) if you want to purchase everything you need locally.
A local two-way radio shop - the kind of place that installs radios in
police cars and fire trucks - may be able to help with the adapters to
get the GPS antenna plugged into the GPS receiver.  Otherwise, mail-
order suppliers like Mouser or Digi-Key can be useful.

Suggestions:

1) Take some photos of the connectors on the ends of the antenna cables
    and on the black box.  With those photos, the listees can give better
    advice.

2) Once you've come up with a 5 V regulated supply that seems to fit
    the black box, plug the DB9 into your computer's serial port, but
    don't plug in the power supply yet.  Also don't worry about hooking
    up the antenna yet.  Open up a terminal program (minicom or similar)
    and set it to what you think the GPS is likely to speak.  Plug the
    power supply into the wall, and then while watching the terminal
    program, plug it into the black box.  If you don't get some kind of
    output in the terminal program within a few seconds, or if you get
    smoke at any time, unplug the power supply from the black box.  If
    you don't get smoke and you do get some kind of recognizable output,
    it should be NMEA (or binary) strings that say &quot;I'm alive but I
    can't see any satellites.&quot;  Once you've got that working, you can
    move on to hooking up the antenna.
