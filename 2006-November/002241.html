If I'm reconstructing the theory behind your statement above correctly,
that spec says REGULATED! in a loud, clear voice.

There's a cheap Micronta digital VOM in the piles 'o stuff somewhere
downstairs, my father dropped it on me many Christmases ago and I am
deeply inexperienced in its uses.

Amazingly, I have actually found it, buried beneath the many many
*many* odd cables in my toolbox.  Even more amazingly, its probe
cables had not gotten separated from it and lost.  I believe I am
about to have a learning experience.

Am now peering at the VOM controls, which are festooned with notations
of which I have only the dimmest comprehension.  There are three
horizontal pairs of jacks, marked (from top to bottom).

OUTPUT                             +DC1200
AC 1200V                           +DC 600V
-COM (500V Max ground)             +V - Ohms - A

The &quot;ground&quot; is actually a ground symbol, the Ohms a capital omega.

The bottom pair of jacks have a sort of tie symbol between 'em
with text in the middle reading:

600V AC
300V DC
300mA DC
   MAX

There are a couple of red lightning bolts next to the AC 1200V and +DC 1200V
symbols, which I'm guessing translate as &quot;be fucking careful or you'll die&quot;.

Finally, a control wheel off to the right.  It's got four modes on it,
&quot;DC A&quot;, &quot;DC V&quot;, &quot;OHMS&quot;, and &quot;AC V&quot; with ranges on each.  Somewhat to my
own surprise I think I understand that, and want DC V with the range set
to 3 volts (the stops are 0.6, 3, 15, and 60).

Selecting the ohmmeter mode and touching the probes to each other
kicks the needle from its rest position at the left to 0 ohms on the
extreme right.  It would appear the instrument is not dead.

Which pair of jacks to use?  I'm thinking the bottom pair looks right,
except that 300mA DC MAX notation worries me. 

&gt;<i>                                             Measure the output voltage
</I>&gt;<i> of the wall wart when it's plugged into the wall and nothing else.  If
</I>&gt;<i> you get a voltage much higher than nominal, it's not regulated.  If you
</I>&gt;<i> get a voltage very close to nominal, it's probably regulated.  If you
</I>&gt;<i> get zero volts, it's either regulated or dead.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> To explain the above: It's not unusual for an unregulated wall wart to
</I>&gt;<i> put out several volts above its nominal output when unloaded.  Seeing 8
</I>&gt;<i> or 9 V for a 5 V nominal wall wart wouldn't be weird.  A regulated wall
</I>&gt;<i> wart should be pretty close to nominal, maybe +/- 5%, or 4.75 to 5.25 V
</I>&gt;<i> for 5 V nominal.  Some kinds of regulated wall warts may not start with
</I>&gt;<i> no load, which is why you might get 0 V.  Using a small incandescent
</I>&gt;<i> lamp as a load (eg a 12 V automotive lamp of a few watts) should load
</I>&gt;<i> it enough to start, at which point the output should be pretty close to
</I>&gt;<i> nominal, again maybe +/- 5%.
</I>
Gadzooks.  I actually understood that!

&gt;<i> There is another way to make an informed guess, but it requires some
</I>&gt;<i> experience.  Unregulated wall warts tend to have physically bigger and
</I>&gt;<i> heavier transformers in them than regulated ones.  After you've picked
</I>&gt;<i> up a few dozen wall warts, you can somewhat correlate the output watts
</I>&gt;<i> vs size and weight, and tell if a particular one is &quot;too light&quot; to be
</I>&gt;<i> an unregulated model.
</I>
This one's on the light side, if I'm any judge.  Which I'm probably not.

But...I'm not sure why I think this, but something about the label
and packaging hints to me that this wall wart was designed by people
with clues and some pride in their work.  It doesn't have the heavy,
clumsy look and cryptic badly-translated-from-some-random-Asian-language 
English I associate with cheapo parts.  If I had to guess, I'd guess this is a
well-designed unit using best available tech.

&gt;<i> &gt;Or...hm...the wall wart is actually plugged into the UPS that runs
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;my computer.  Could it be that whatever power smoothing the UPS is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;doing is making regulation in the wall wart unnecessary?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I vote for &quot;possible, but unlikely&quot;.  Having a constant line voltage to
</I>&gt;<i> an unregulated wall wart will help stabilize its output voltage, but its
</I>&gt;<i> output voltage will also depend on how much current the load (in this
</I>&gt;<i> case, the Sandpiper) is drawing.  In this particular case, the Sandpiper
</I>&gt;<i> is *probably* doing about the same amount of computing all the time, so
</I>&gt;<i> its current draw *should be* fairly constant, which means the voltage
</I>&gt;<i> *should be* fairly constant.  You can probably get away with it, but it
</I>&gt;<i> may come back to haunt you some day.
</I>
Got it.  Most informative, thank you.
