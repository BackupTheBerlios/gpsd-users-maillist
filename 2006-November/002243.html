Yep, it's most likely regulated.

This is perhaps a little far afield from GPS software development, but
here goes...

&gt;<i> There's a cheap Micronta digital VOM in the piles 'o stuff somewhere

</I>&gt;<i> deeply inexperienced in its uses.
</I>
Micronta == Radio Shack.  For all their many failings, Radio Shack is
fairly good about having manuals for older products online.  The model
number will be either on the face of the meter or on a sticker on the
back and will probably be of the form 22-[0-9][0-9][0-9] .  Put that
model number in the search box at radioshack.com and you'll probably get
a PDF of the manual.

&gt;<i> OUTPUT                             +DC1200
</I>&gt;<i> AC 1200V                           +DC 600V
</I>&gt;<i> -COM (500V Max ground)             +V - Ohms - A
</I>
Most of the time you will have the black one plugged into -COM and the
red one plugged into +V - Omega - A.  You might plug the red one into
AC 1200V, +DC1200, or +DC 600V if you are measuring really high
voltages.

The (500V Max ground) on -COM means that the -COM terminal shouldn't be
more than 500 V above earth potential.  In practice it will be hard for
a mild-mannered computer hacker to exceed this, as long as he stays out
of microwave ovens, CRT monitors and TVs, and the circuit breaker panels
at a commercial office building or factory.

&gt;<i> The bottom pair of jacks have a sort of tie symbol between 'em
</I>&gt;<i> with text in the middle reading:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 600V AC  300V DC  300mA DC  MAX
</I>
This is the maximum voltage or current you should apply to these two
jacks.

&gt;<i> There are a couple of red lightning bolts next to the AC 1200V and
</I>&gt;<i> +DC 1200V symbols, which I'm guessing translate as &quot;be fucking careful
</I>&gt;<i> or you'll die&quot;.
</I>
If you're lucky you can kill yourself with a 1.5 V alkaline cell, but
yeah, the higher the voltage the easier it is.

&gt;<i> Finally, a control wheel off to the right.  It's got four modes on it,
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;DC A&quot;, &quot;DC V&quot;, &quot;OHMS&quot;, and &quot;AC V&quot; with ranges on each.  Somewhat to my
</I>&gt;<i> own surprise I think I understand that, and want DC V with the range set
</I>&gt;<i> to 3 volts (the stops are 0.6, 3, 15, and 60).
</I>
Basically, you want to select range = ceil(expected_input).  The 3 V
range would be OK for an alkaline cell (1.5 V or less) but won't work
very well on a 5 V power supply.  The 15 V range would be better for the
5 V supply.  The 60 V range would also work, but it'll be pretty hard to
tell the difference between 5 V and 10 V, since it'll all be squished
down in one end of the range.  If expected_input is unknown, you start
at the highest range and work down.

&gt;<i> Selecting the ohmmeter mode and touching the probes to each other
</I>&gt;<i> kicks the needle from its rest position at the left to 0 ohms on the
</I>&gt;<i> extreme right.  It would appear the instrument is not dead.
</I>
There is an internal battery that makes the ohms range work, and this is
indeed a sign that it is good.  Even without the battery, the meter
should still work on volts and amps.

&gt;<i> Which pair of jacks to use?  I'm thinking the bottom pair looks right,
</I>&gt;<i> except that 300mA DC MAX notation worries me.
</I>
I think you're right.  The 300 mA max refers to a current measurement
(DC A) which you don't want to do - you want to measure voltage, DC V.

The other part of using an analog meter is figuring out which of the
several parallel scales to read.  The best advice I can give is to find
some known voltages and fool around until you understand it.  A fresh
alkaline cell is 1.5 V, a freshly-charged NiCd or NiMH battery is 1.2 to
1.3 V, a fresh 9 volt battery is guess what, a car battery is about 12.6 v
with the engine not running or up to 14 V or so with the engine running,
etc.  The disk drive power connectors in a desktop computer will likely
have +5 V and +12 V on them.  A POTS (telephone) line will be something
like -48 V on-hook, down to as low as -5 or -10 V off-hook.  You probably
have some other wall warts that you can measure, too.  As long as you
stick to the &quot;DC V&quot; and &quot;AC V&quot; ranges and measure things that are 60 V
or less, you probably won't blow up your meter or yourself.  Read the
manual before venturing on to &quot;DC A&quot; or &quot;OHMS&quot;.

&gt;<i> Gadzooks.  I actually understood that!
</I>
There's nothing more dangerous than a programmer with a screwdriver.  :)

&gt;<i> It doesn't have the heavy, clumsy look and cryptic badly-translated-
</I>&gt;<i> from-some-random-Asian-language English I associate with cheapo parts.
</I>
That can also be a good clue.  However, as time goes on, the fake
Chinese parts are getting better and better at having nice-looking
(but fake) labels, plausible-looking (but fake) UL marks, etc.

If you want to get into basic trouble, get the book described at
<A HREF="http://www.forrestmims.com/">http://www.forrestmims.com/</A> .  Radio Shack doesn't sell this any more,
but you can get it online from other sources.  Once you've done everything
in that book, get into advanced trouble with this one:
<A HREF="http://www.artofelectronics.com/">http://www.artofelectronics.com/</A> .

Standard disclaimers apply; I don't get money or other considerations
from any of the companies mentioned.
