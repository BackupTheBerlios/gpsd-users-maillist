Maybe.

What's the input specification on the wall wart label?  If it just has
one value, like &quot;120 V AC&quot; then it may or may not be regulated.  If it
has a wide range, like &quot;90-250 V AC&quot;, then it's most likely regulated.

If you have a voltmeter, it's easy to tell.  Measure the output voltage
of the wall wart when it's plugged into the wall and nothing else.  If
you get a voltage much higher than nominal, it's not regulated.  If you
get a voltage very close to nominal, it's probably regulated.  If you
get zero volts, it's either regulated or dead.

To explain the above: It's not unusual for an unregulated wall wart to
put out several volts above its nominal output when unloaded.  Seeing 8
or 9 V for a 5 V nominal wall wart wouldn't be weird.  A regulated wall
wart should be pretty close to nominal, maybe +/- 5%, or 4.75 to 5.25 V
for 5 V nominal.  Some kinds of regulated wall warts may not start with
no load, which is why you might get 0 V.  Using a small incandescent
lamp as a load (eg a 12 V automotive lamp of a few watts) should load
it enough to start, at which point the output should be pretty close to
nominal, again maybe +/- 5%.

There is another way to make an informed guess, but it requires some
experience.  Unregulated wall warts tend to have physically bigger and
heavier transformers in them than regulated ones.  After you've picked
up a few dozen wall warts, you can somewhat correlate the output watts
vs size and weight, and tell if a particular one is &quot;too light&quot; to be
an unregulated model.

&gt;<i> Or...hm...the wall wart is actually plugged into the UPS that runs
</I>&gt;<i> my computer.  Could it be that whatever power smoothing the UPS is
</I>&gt;<i> doing is making regulation in the wall wart unnecessary?
</I>
I vote for &quot;possible, but unlikely&quot;.  Having a constant line voltage to
an unregulated wall wart will help stabilize its output voltage, but its
output voltage will also depend on how much current the load (in this
case, the Sandpiper) is drawing.  In this particular case, the Sandpiper
is *probably* doing about the same amount of computing all the time, so
its current draw *should be* fairly constant, which means the voltage
*should be* fairly constant.  You can probably get away with it, but it
may come back to haunt you some day.

For far more than you probably wanted to know about it, read &quot;Part I&quot;
