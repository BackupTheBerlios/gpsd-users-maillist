<PRE>Preparatory to release, and so everybody knows the state of play,
I have revised the bug list in our TODO file.  To the best of 
everyone's knowledge, is this both correct and complete?

----------------------------------------------------------------------

*** Support for the True North magnetic compass is currently broken

Massimo Burcheri reported that it broke somewhere between rev 3654 and
3722.  We think this is a shallow bug, but we can't fix it without
test hardware.  If TNT support is a problem for you, and you can't
fix the driver yourself and send us the patch, contact Bill Powell 
&lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-users">bpowell at tntc.com</A>&gt; at True North Technologies and tell him he needs
to send us an eval unit.

*** Support for Garmin USB binary in serial mode is currently broken

We rewrote the Garmin USB binary support in a different mode to
work around a bug in the Linux 2.16 tty layer.  Unfortunately the new
driver has some kind of bad timing interaction with the kernel
(probably due to another kernel bug) and only works at -D6 or up.

The new driver also requires a tool to switch between binary and NMEA
modes.  There is experimental untested code to do this via gpsctl, but
it could do anything including make bats fly out of your nose.

The new Garmin driver and gpsctl should be much more solid in the next
point release.

*** PPS support is temporarily broken.

It got sideswiped during the architectural changes need to implement
the new gpsctl tool.  We should have this fixed in the next release.

*** Devices based on SirFStar I chips are not properly autodetected

Devices based on the now-obsolete SiRfStar I chip, like the Axiom
Sandpiper II OEM module, are not properly detected by gpsd's 
autoprobe logic and remain in NMEA mode rather than being switched
to SiRF binary.  

The project lead has a Sandpiper to test with, and one of our
contributors thinks he has a way to snoop on the way SiRFDemo (SiRF's
official device control program) does this, so we should be able to
solve this problem.

*** There's a report that RoyalTek support broke between 2.25 and 2.28 

There's a report that RoyalTek support broke between 2.25 and 2.28 by
David Mandala &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-users">davidm at them.com</A>&gt;.  His workaround is to condition out
SiRF support; it works OK in NMEA mode.  The Royaltek died in an
accident, so we're stuck until someone else can test this.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

I'm going to work on the Sandpiper problem.  Other than that and
merging more of Chris's pile of documents onto the website, I have
run out of things to do before release.
