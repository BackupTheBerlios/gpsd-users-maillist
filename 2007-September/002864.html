not even a little bit. that would mean i'd actually have to have a
windows box of some decent specification. the only thing that comes
close is a dual-boot partition on my laptop so i can look stuff up
with ms streets &amp; trips[1], and occasionally run some vendor-supplied
gps tools[2]. for the last 10 years or so, i've been computing happily
without attachment to windows, and i don't intend to develop such an
attachment now.

[1] i bought  a tomtom, and use google maps a lot more, and gpsbabel
talks to both of those.
[2] i've written stuff in perl to do much of what sirfdemo does, so
it's certainly not beyond me to replicate this functionality on UN*X
if i really wanted to be an anti-windows zealot.

&gt;<i> so it may be a more effective use of your efforts to put together
</I>&gt;<i> a windows gpsd cygwin package and direct users to download
</I>&gt;<i> and install it whenever they install gpsdrive.  I would love to see
</I>&gt;<i> a native windows version of gpsd but cygwin gets the job done
</I>&gt;<i> and licensing isn't an issue between the two.
</I>
i have no objection to seeing a windows port. i won't feel hurt if i
never see any diffs either (the license does allow that sort of
behaviour), but some other users might be interested. if the diff is
clean, and doesn't mess up the rest of the source tree, i might even
consider integrating it. i'd be more inclined to look favourably on
windows portability code if someone stepped up and committed to
ongoing maintenance.

GDB has a 'break' feature; why doesn't it have 'fix' too?
