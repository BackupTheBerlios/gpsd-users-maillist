I did some more experimenting and this is what I have figured out.
If I run the command &quot;cardctl status&quot;, among the things it reports is 
[req attn].  This is absent when doing the same on the zaurus.  What 
does this mean?  I haven't been successful with google.

Using &quot;cardctl config&quot; I find that it has a shared irq (also find out by 
dmesg) of 11 but on the zaurus it has an exclusive irq of 136.  Could 
this shared irq cause it to not function?  I went into the kernel config 
and found an option to allow sharing irq.  How can it get an exclusive one?

Here is a strange one:  When I insert the card on the zaurus dmesg 
reports ttyS03 but I tell gpsd to connect to /dev/ttyS3.  What does the 
0 mean and why can't I connect to ttyS03 (it doesn't work)?  The zaurus 
is ALWAYS ttyS03/ttyS3 but on the laptop it changes between ttyS0 and 
ttyS1.  I am totally confused on this one and I don't understand enough 
about the dev structure of linux to figure it out.

I also booted up ubuntu live cd  and the gentoo live cd and tried cating 
the device that dmesg shows and still no result.  So, at this point I 
think it is either a hardware issue with this laptop or I need some 
special config for this card when it is inserted (something that the 
zaurus must have built in).

Thanks for the help guys.  I'm going to try posting this in the gentoo 
forums and see if anyone knows there.  I'll also try to talk to ckuethe 
if I catch him in the irc channel.
