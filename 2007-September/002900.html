<PRE>
This is to report that I've successfully used my &quot;KeyMate 300&quot; with gpsd under
Mandriva Linux 2007.1 without any setup (hotplug starts gpsd when I plug my
device).

Why did I said that 3 new devices are supported (or known to be supported but
not on the hardware page)? Because these are the sames:

Brand - Model - Firmware revision - firmware reference
Globalsat - GH-601      - 1.15 - F-0TH-0C-0609292
                          ?.?? - F-0TH-0C-0705142
Geonaute  - KeyMaze 300 - 2.20 - F-0TH-0C-0704262
Navilock  - NL-101H     - ?.?? - F-0TH-0C-0703122

Note that Globalsat - GH-602 seems to a 601 with a digital compas. It wouldn't
be a surprise if it worked out of the box as well (but I didn't test).

Would be good to have the hardware page updated as those devices are cheap and
are subject to be widely spread.

Note that in order to work, the gps antena mode must be activated (called &quot;GPS
MOUSE&quot;)

In france, the Geonaute KeyMaze 300 is sold by the sport shop Decathlon at
99.9&#8364; and seems to be a success. Decathlon says that Linux is not
supported wich is not exactly the case. The GPS antena mode *IS* working
perfectly. xgps displays the GPS satelites constellation and gpsdrive is working
fine.
The only unsupported thing is the data retrieval IMHO (or I didn't figure it out
yet)

BTW, if anybody know of a software (free) that is able to retrieve gps logs from
one of those devices, that would be cool.
