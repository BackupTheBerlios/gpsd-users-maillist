While I have good and bad experience both with Windows and Linux, my job 
forces me to use Windows. As it's a pita (IMHO) to maintain two 
different platforms at home and work, so I'll keep on using Windows at 
home as well (exactly for this reason). However, having good Win32 ports 
of open source software available is IMO doing a pretty good job to 
promote open source software in general!!!

</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>Unmaintained code is not - per se - a bad thing. For example: Keeping 
the work of previous attempts to port win32 stuff might help further 
attempts ...

However, think of this: I don't know how many windows developers simply 
&quot;disappeared&quot; looking at the gpsd homepage reading this: &quot;No, we don't 
support Windows &#8212; get a better operating system&quot;. Even after working 
more than 10 years in the software industry, I don't know what a &quot;better 
operating system&quot; really is! So in my eyes this *is* a political 
statement and nothing else. In fact this statement drove me away from 
any gpsd related development for more than two years!
&gt;<i> as for pretty diffs .... make it easy for people without win32
</I>&gt;<i> experience to a) not be confused by the abstraction layer and b) not
</I>&gt;<i> mess up the abstraction layer
</I>... as always ;-)
