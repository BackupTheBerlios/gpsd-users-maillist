<PRE>Hi,

i have a little problem. Please let me explain: I have a bluetooth gps (a xaiox diamond) using the sirf3 chipset.
I want to use this for geocaching, but it came with &quot;static navigation&quot; enabled. I soon found out that i have to
switch to sirf mode, change the setting and return to nmea. sirfmon can do all that. The gps was detected as
9600 bit/s and successfully switched to sirf mode my sirfmon. So far so good. Then i could see that indeed
the setting was &quot;static navigation&quot; and i could change it using the c0 command of sirfmon.  The 't' command 
showed that this worked. But returning to nmea mode using the 'n' command made the device unusable. It
returned gabage that was neither sirf nor nmea (basically a bunch of 0x80's, 0xff's and 0x00's). Luckily it 
has a replaceable battery so i was able to easily reset it by removing the battery.

The problem is: Bluetooth actually doesn't use a rs232 bitrate. Setting bitrates on a bluetooth rfcomm link
doesn't do any more than sending a matching request to change the bitrate to the client device. It now depends
on two things if this actually succeeds: 1) the kernel has to actually build and send the correct message to
make the client change its bitrate and 2) the client has to implement the actual bit rate change. I am not
100% sure about (1), but i think this isn't implemented in the current kernel. Furthermore (2) is something
that isn't really predictable as some device do this and some don't. As long as the bluetooth chip inside the
device and the gps chip inside the device use the same bitrate on the short connection between them 
everything is fine. The PC isn't really involved in this.

But there's a problem with this: sirfmons baudrate hunt is immediately successful at its first try at the gps 
just works fine since the bluetooth link actually doesn't care for the specified bitrate. sirfmon thus thinks 
the device is using 9600 bit/s whereas the device internal link actually is 38400 bit/s (i'll explain later on how 
i know this). This gets a problem in the moment sirfmon returns the device into nmea mode as inside the 
command doing that is a bitrate specified. This is the bitrate that was determined during the hunt (9600 
bit/s in my case for the above reasons). Now this command switches the gps chip in the device to 
9600 bit/s. The problem is that the bluetooth chip in that very same device is still working at its different 
default bit rate thus the link goes mad. By repeatedly patching sirfmon into thinking the gps is running 19k2, 
38k4 etc etc i managed to successfully return to nmea mode when making sirfmon think the link runs at 
38k4. I thus know that the device internal link runs at 38400bit/s (38k4).

Two solutions exist for this problem: 1) make the Linux kernel handle the bluetooth bit rate requests
correctly (e.g. doing a &quot;stty -F /dev/rfcomm0 speed 38400&quot; should make the correct request to be sent
to the client device). BUT: This just won't help if the client ignores such a request whch indeed many
device do. 2) Give sirfmon a command line option forcing it into believing what i specify as the bitrate 
instead of believing what the hunt returned as a working bitrate. 

(2) works for me. What do you think? Does such an option for sirfmon make sense? Is there a different solution to this
problem that i missed?

Regards,
  Till
