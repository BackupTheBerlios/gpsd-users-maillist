&gt;<i> I've been using gpsd for some time now on an embedded linux system but it happens that I have to migrate my application to windows :(.  I can get my application to build and run fine under cygwin but linking to the cygwin dll means that my code must be GPL'd  if I wish to distribute or sell it (unless I buy a license from Redhat).  The funding for this project prohibits this code from being opened so here is what I've done:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1.  I've gotten gpsd to compile and run on windows under cygwin.  I can distribute the cygwin.dll and the gpsd compiled to run on cygwin as long as I make the sources for cygwin and gpsd available.  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2. I modified my application so I can build it using mingw32.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3. I modified libgps.c and several other gpsd source files so they will build under mingw32.  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 4.  I have linked the libgps code directly into my application.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Since gpsd is released under a BSD license I can safely modify it and link it into my application correct?  Any other thoughts or concerns about licensing issues?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Is anyone else interested in my changes to get gpsd and libgps working in windows?
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>Hi!

Yes, I would also be very interested in a gpsd windows port, BTW: my 
main interest in using gps(d) software is related with work on the 
<A HREF="http://www.openstreetmap.org">http://www.openstreetmap.org</A> project.

I'm currently working on a Windows port of gpsdrive 
(<A HREF="http://www.gpsdrive.de/">http://www.gpsdrive.de/</A>) and making good progress with it. 
Unfortunately, gpsdrive without gpsd is obviously a bit pointless ;-)

I had build gpsd using cygwin, but when I tried to run it it just 
stopped without any warning or error message. You seem to be more 
successful with this approach :-) I'll try your patch shortly.


Unfortunately a cygwin solution get's probably in the way of a hassle 
free installation procedure for a common Windows user. Having cygwin as 
a requirement on a user machine is not such a good idea (although the 
cygwin installation is not that complicated, but it adds another step). 
On the other hand, let gpsd work as a service and install a &quot;standalone&quot; 
cygwin1.dll somewhere in system32 cries for dll version conflicts. Or do 
I miss something here?

So I would really like to have a native (without any mingw or cygwin) 
Windows port of gpsd using Visual Studio C++ 2005 Express Edition (free 
as in beer). Having a native Win32 port - at least for libgps - is 
probably a must for wider adoption of other gps related open / free 
software on windows (I'm not really interested in closed source gps 
software myself).

I've started to implement a native gpsd Win32 port. Most of the gpsd 
sources can be compiled without real problems (usual things like send() 
vs. write() for socket I/O). I currently already get a gpsd.exe, but 
there are still some real hacks in it, like most functions from serial.c 
are just faked (implemented empty in config.c). I'm currently still 
facing two real problems:
1) termios is not available on Win32 - I need to rewrite serial.c almost 
completely (and have a look for serial I/O spreaded throughout the rest 
of the gpsd code, like tcflush())
2) select() doesn't work with none socket fd's (like the serial I/O 
fd's) on Win32 - I need to rewrite the select() call in gpsd.c, and use 
WaitForMultipleObjects() instead

My long term goal for a native Win32 port would be to encapsulate this 
stuff into platform specific files (candidates are gpsd.c and serial.c 
(maybe netlib.c), as they will be pretty different on Linux/Unix and 
Win32) and have the rest of the gpsd code as equal as ever possible.

I don't know if I will face even more serious problems while I'm 
implementing the Win32 port - and how far I will get / succeed at all ;-)

Regards, ULFL
