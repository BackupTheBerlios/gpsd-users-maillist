<PRE>Gary,

Ok, I will try to keep my questions simple then if I cannot provide full
information. Thanks for looking at it.

For anyone that was following this, the problem ended up being a problem
with the private driver union structure in gpsd.h. I didn't realize that
all of the driver private housekeeping data was inside of a union and so
since my driver was using information from both nmea and my own driver,
there was a place where the data was overlapping in a critical fashion.

Regards,


Roderick

And thus the fix, if any, in gpsd might be completely custom for your
new driver, but I doubt it.  So don't ask us to help with one hand tied
behind our backs.   Please supply test cases and debug output.

No buts about it, please send in a patch.  Input sanitization seems to
be half of what gpsd is all about.  GPS makers are always inventing
new ways to screw up.

</I>
Well that is part of the problem.  If you do not give gpsd a year then
gpsd does not have a year and that is a big problem.

&gt;<i> In looking at the code, I can't find a place where the year might be
</I>&gt;<i> initialized to some particular value to start with.

Check out the big comment at line 56 in driver_nmea.c from git head.
