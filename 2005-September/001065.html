<PRE>System info: Debian stable up to date.

Checked out revision 3216 of gpsd

Desired to build a version with no binary support only NEMA

Two problems found.

First:
When running ./autogen
src/test$ ./autogen.sh

Your automake version  is older than the suggested one, 1.7.6
Go on at your own risk. :-)

Configuring build environment for gpsd
automake: configure.ac: installing `./install-sh'
automake: configure.ac: installing `./mkinstalldirs'
automake: configure.ac: installing `./missing'
Makefile.am:8: HAVE_MOTIF does not appear in AM_CONDITIONAL
Makefile.am:14: HAVE_DBUS does not appear in AM_CONDITIONAL
Makefile.am:22: invalid variable `dist_bin_SCRIPTS'
Makefile.am:22: invalid variable `dist_bin_SCRIPTS'
Makefile.am:152: warning: automake does not support conditional 
definition of DBUSPAGES in man_MANS
Makefile.am:128: invalid unused variable name: `nodist_libgps_la_SOURCES'

and you don't get a configure command to use.

If you run each command
aclocal \
   &amp;&amp; libtoolize --force --copy \
   &amp;&amp; autoheader --force \
   &amp;&amp; automake --add-missing --foreign --copy \
   &amp;&amp; autoconf --force \
   &amp;&amp; echo Now running configure to configure gpsd \
   &amp;&amp; echo &quot;./configure $@&quot; \
   &amp;&amp; ./configure $@

manually you get:

<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-users">davidm at nscdev</A>:~/work/src/test$ aclocal
<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-users">davidm at nscdev</A>:~/work/src/test$ libtoolize --force --copy
<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-users">davidm at nscdev</A>:~/work/src/test$ autoheader --force
<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-users">davidm at nscdev</A>:~/work/src/test$ automake --add-missing --foreign --copy

Makefile.am:8: HAVE_MOTIF does not appear in AM_CONDITIONAL
Makefile.am:14: HAVE_DBUS does not appear in AM_CONDITIONAL
Makefile.am:22: invalid variable `dist_bin_SCRIPTS'
Makefile.am:22: invalid variable `dist_bin_SCRIPTS'
Makefile.am:152: warning: automake does not support conditional 
definition of DBUSPAGES in man_MANS
Makefile.am:128: invalid unused variable name: `nodist_libgps_la_SOURCES'

<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-users">davidm at nscdev</A>:~/work/src/test$ autoconf --force

And now you have a configure application.

Second problem found, can not build NEMA only support garmin and 
evermore collide in some fashion. Examples below:


With Garmin and Evermore support left on:

==========================================
gpsd 2.30
------------------------------------------
NMEA                    : yes
FV-18                   : no
SiRF-II                 : no
Trimble TSIP            : no
Tripmate                : no
Earthmate               : no
iTrax                   : no
iTalk                   : no
Garmin                  : yes
True North              : no
Evermore                : yes
RTCM104 support         : no
NTP SHM                 : yes
NTP PPS                 : no
Enable shared libraries : yes
Enable DBUS support     : no
------------------------------------------
Configure finished, type 'make' to build.

Note Evermore shows up as yes

This will build.

Now Gramin left on and Evermore off:

==========================================
gpsd 2.30
------------------------------------------
NMEA                    : yes
FV-18                   : no
SiRF-II                 : no
Trimble TSIP            : no
Tripmate                : no
Earthmate               : no
iTrax                   : no
iTalk                   : no
Garmin                  : yes
True North              : no
Evermore                :
RTCM104 support         : no
NTP SHM                 : yes
NTP PPS                 : no
Enable shared libraries : yes
Enable DBUS support     : no
------------------------------------------
Configure finished, type 'make' to build.

Note first hint of problem, Evermore is blank not &quot;no&quot;

This will build.

==========================================
gpsd 2.30
------------------------------------------
NMEA                    : yes
FV-18                   : no
SiRF-II                 : no
Trimble TSIP            : no
Tripmate                : no
Earthmate               : no
iTrax                   : no
iTalk                   : no
Garmin                  : no
True North              : no
Evermore                : yes
RTCM104 support         : no
NTP SHM                 : yes
NTP PPS                 : no
Enable shared libraries : yes
Enable DBUS support     : no
------------------------------------------
Configure finished, type 'make' to build.

Note Evermore does show up as &quot;yes&quot;

This will build.

Garmin and Evermore off
==========================================
gpsd 2.30
------------------------------------------
NMEA                    : yes
FV-18                   : no
SiRF-II                 : no
Trimble TSIP            : no
Tripmate                : no
Earthmate               : no
iTrax                   : no
iTalk                   : no
Garmin                  : no
True North              : no
Evermore                :
RTCM104 support         : no
NTP SHM                 : yes
NTP PPS                 : no
Enable shared libraries : yes
Enable DBUS support     : no
------------------------------------------
Configure finished, type 'make' to build.

Again Evermore is blank instead of &quot;no&quot;

Runing make gets:
