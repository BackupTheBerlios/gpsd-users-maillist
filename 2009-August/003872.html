Yeah, I only started looking at the code 1 day ago, but my observation 
is that it doesn't seem to proactively change port speed when scanning.  
For me this means that if I use a generic NMEA talker which only speaks 
at 38400 then it's not detected by default and if I change the port 
speed on a 4800 NMEA talker then it's not found if I first &quot;break it&quot; 
using stty to change port speed to something other than 4800

The code gives the appearance it had baud setting in mind, but I think 
we need the devs to answer the question as to whether this is intended 
behaviour or not?  Perhaps move your question to the -dev list if you 
don't get a response here?
