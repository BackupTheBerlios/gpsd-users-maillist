</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and build the gpsd 2.39 source &quot;as is,&quot; gpsd does not recognize the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> packets as binary TSIP packets and eventually goes through all the baud 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> rates at 8N1, then again at 7E2 without ever recognizing any packets. 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> However, if I hack the &quot;gpsd_open()&quot; function in serial.c so that it 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> does &quot;gpsd_set_speed(session, 9600, 'O', 1)&quot; on line 276 to force the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> correct baud rate and parity, it recognizes TSIP packets immediately. 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Since my application is an embedded device with known GPS hardware, I 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> don't mind doing the hack to make it work, so this isn't a big issue for 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> me. But I thought I should report the issue because it appears to me 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that gpsd is supposed to recognize TSIP at 8N1, then switch to odd 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> parity after it knows it's talking TSIP, but this is not happening in my 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> case. And I would prefer to use a standard unhacked version of gpsd if I 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> can.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> TSIP is weird, and our standard hunt sequence is known to be failure-prone

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Fortunately, you have an easy out.  Configure your build with
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 	     --enable-fixed-port-speed=9600
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> and all should, in theory, be well.  I say &quot;in theory&quot; because that
</I>&gt;<i> build hasn't to my knowledge been tested for a while. Look for
</I>&gt;<i> FIXED_PORT_SPEED in drivers.c, gpsd.c, and serial.c to understand
</I>&gt;<i> what's going on.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>Thanks Eric.  I did try this, along with disabling a bunch of protocols 
but it did not help.  Probably because it still does not attempt odd 
parity.  And I'll go along with &quot;TSIP is weird.&quot;  I've seen lots of 
serial devices in my years of programming but I've never seen a device 
that uses odd parity or a device that uses parity with 8 data bits.
