<PRE>hello jens --

 &gt; Hi Paul
 &gt; 
 &gt; We have the same problem with u-Blox devices, though the delay is only 5
 &gt; seconds.
 &gt; See <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/pipermail/gpsd-users/2009-January/003566.html">https://lists.berlios.de/pipermail/gpsd-users/2009-January/003566.html</A>
 &gt; We are using version 2.32 now (as far as I remember) which works correct.

if i could reproduce the problem reliably, i would certainly do that.
unfortunately, the condition has gone away, so everything's fine right
now.  i'm sure it's waiting for my next road trip to reappear.

 &gt; Could you give that version and the next a try, so we can be sure the
 &gt; bug came in with that changes. My workmates thought it's a problem with
 &gt; u-Blox only.
 &gt; What OS are you using?

fedora F-9, on an OPLC XO laptop.

i see in your earlier thread you write that the problem only occurs
with a USB connection, not with serial.  how do you test the same
device in both ways?

just to add more confusion to the current discussion (more is
good, right ;-), i'll add that in may of last year i wrote here
concerning the 5-second latency i was experiencing with my
bluetooth MTK-based receiver.  at the time my serial receiver
(the one i currently get 15 second delays from sometimes) was
working perfectly:
    <A HREF="../2008-May/003239.html">http://lists.berlios.de/pipermail/gpsd-users/2008-May/003239.html</A>

i haven't been using the bluetooth receiver much recently, for
other reasons, but i'll try it again today, just to see.

paul
p.s. anyone know if the owners of lists.berlios.de are pursuing
a new security certificate?

 &gt; Bye,

 &gt; &gt; hi --
 &gt; &gt; 
 &gt; &gt; i'm having a very strange delay issue with my sirf receiver.
 &gt; &gt; 
 &gt; &gt; i use a sirf-based USB mouse attached to a (linux) laptop running
 &gt; &gt; a mapping program.  some days (like today) everything works
 &gt; &gt; perfectly.  other days (like yesterday) GPS reports are delayed
 &gt; &gt; by a full 14 or 15 seconds from when they really happen.
 &gt; &gt; 
 &gt; &gt; to describe the behavior in more detail:  if i'm traveling, the
 &gt; &gt; trail followed by the mapping program's cursor follows my actual
 &gt; &gt; trail exactly (meaning that the position reports are all correct)
 &gt; &gt; but each is delayed by 15 seconds -- i can come to a stop at
 &gt; &gt; an intersection, and watch the cursor &quot;catch up&quot;.  or, if i'm on
 &gt; &gt; a bus, and we come to a stop, the speed reported from the device
 &gt; &gt; comes to a stop 15 seconds later -- it inicates 0m/s for the duration
 &gt; &gt; of the stop, then starts climbing 14 seconds after the bus has
 &gt; &gt; started moving.  this is observed using my mapping client, or
 &gt; &gt; using gpsmon.  if using gpsmon, i can observe this behavior
 &gt; &gt; whether using gpsd as the data source, or when connecting
 &gt; &gt; directly to /dev/ttyUSB0.  gps data seems to arrive at the usual
 &gt; &gt; rate -- an update or two per second.
 &gt; &gt; 
 &gt; &gt; while i can't fully interpret what i'm seeing, it sure feels like
 &gt; &gt; either my sirf chip, or the USB stack (!?) is in some sort of
 &gt; &gt; wayback mode.  has anyone else ever seen anything like this?
 &gt; &gt; 
 &gt; &gt; when the problem is occuring (and i've had it happen enough that
 &gt; &gt; i've watched it quite a bit, both with my map program, and
 &gt; &gt; gpsmon), it's so reliably &quot;wrong&quot; that it feels deliberate --
 &gt; &gt; i.e., it feels like a debug flag in the sirf firmware has been
 &gt; &gt; set (the &quot;delay all reports by 14 seconds&quot; debug flag?).  are
 &gt; &gt; there any sirf dumping utilities that i could use to get a more
 &gt; &gt; complete picture of the receiver's state?)  i haven't figured out
 &gt; &gt; any way of forcing the receiver in or out of this odd mode --
 &gt; &gt; unplugging/replugging/reopening the device usually has no affect.
 &gt; &gt; 
 &gt; &gt; versions:  i've been using svn r5863 of gpsd.  if someone can tell me
 &gt; &gt; how to get the sirf firmware version number, i'll provide it.
 &gt; &gt; 
 &gt; &gt; thanks!
 &gt; &gt;
