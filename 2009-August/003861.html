<PRE>hi --

i'm having a very strange delay issue with my sirf receiver.

i use a sirf-based USB mouse attached to a (linux) laptop running
a mapping program.  some days (like today) everything works
perfectly.  other days (like yesterday) GPS reports are delayed
by a full 14 or 15 seconds from when they really happen.

to describe the behavior in more detail:  if i'm traveling, the
trail followed by the mapping program's cursor follows my actual
trail exactly (meaning that the position reports are all correct)
but each is delayed by 15 seconds -- i can come to a stop at
an intersection, and watch the cursor &quot;catch up&quot;.  or, if i'm on
a bus, and we come to a stop, the speed reported from the device
comes to a stop 15 seconds later -- it inicates 0m/s for the duration
of the stop, then starts climbing 14 seconds after the bus has
started moving.  this is observed using my mapping client, or
using gpsmon.  if using gpsmon, i can observe this behavior
whether using gpsd as the data source, or when connecting
directly to /dev/ttyUSB0.  gps data seems to arrive at the usual
rate -- an update or two per second.

while i can't fully interpret what i'm seeing, it sure feels like
either my sirf chip, or the USB stack (!?) is in some sort of
wayback mode.  has anyone else ever seen anything like this?

when the problem is occuring (and i've had it happen enough that
i've watched it quite a bit, both with my map program, and
gpsmon), it's so reliably &quot;wrong&quot; that it feels deliberate --
i.e., it feels like a debug flag in the sirf firmware has been
set (the &quot;delay all reports by 14 seconds&quot; debug flag?).  are
there any sirf dumping utilities that i could use to get a more
complete picture of the receiver's state?)  i haven't figured out
any way of forcing the receiver in or out of this odd mode --
unplugging/replugging/reopening the device usually has no affect.

versions:  i've been using svn r5863 of gpsd.  if someone can tell me
how to get the sirf firmware version number, i'll provide it.

thanks!

paul
