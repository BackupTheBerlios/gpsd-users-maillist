<PRE>After two months of hard (but very rewarding) work, the new JSON-based
GPSD command protocol is in a stable and apparently working state.  It is
ready for experimentation and beta-testing.

I am very pleased to be able to report that despite the extended
capabilities of the new protocol, the new client-side API is actually
*simpler* than the old, no longer requiring you to stuff bits of
the wire protocol into gps_query() argument strings.

I've written a transition document that explains the changes and
gives tips for client developers here:

      <A HREF="http://gpsd.berlios.de/protocol-transition.html">http://gpsd.berlios.de/protocol-transition.html</A>

The GPS reports in the new protocol are fully supported by libgps, and
most of the test clients in the distribution (xgps, xgpsspeed,
gpxlogger, lcdgps) actually use them now.  (Actually, libgps will
recognize either protocol.)

Known issues:

* The ?DEVICE invocations corresponding to old B, C, and N still need
  testing on live devices.

* The Python and C++ client libraries presently speak only old protocol.

* gpsmon's client mode still relies on old protocol (that's my problem)

* cgps.c still relies on old protocol (that's Jeff Francis's problem).

* While gpsd will ship AIS JSON when attached to a transceiver, the C
  client library doen't unpack the JSON into the C structs defined in
  gps.h as yet. This should be a relatively simple coding job, maybe two
  man-days of work counting time to build the unit tests.

* RTCM2 is still dumped in the idiosyncratic Sager protocol rather
  than JSON.  I've written a JSON-RTCM2 dumper but have no parser
  yet; that should be even easier than the AIS job.

* RTCM3 support is nonexistent due to a lack of suitable test loads.
  (We have binary RTCM3; what we need it a *pair* of files, one that
  is binary RTCM3 and the other that is the identical content dumped
  in some sort of readable textual format.)

Known pre-2.40 issues unrelated to new protocol:

* We've had a report that trunk gpsd eats the processor in some
  situations, apparently due to spinning in a repeating open-close 
  loop on some devices.  I've never seen this; the person who
  reported the bug mentined it on #gpsd but has since gone silent.

* The tendency of SiRF chips to lag real-time by 15 seconds or so
  under some (unexplained) circumstances is still...unexplained. Or,
  rather, we have several different possible explanations and have
  not been able to verify any of them.

You need only reflect that one of the best ways to get yourself a
reputation as a dangerous citizen these days is to go about repeating
the very phrases which our founding fathers used in the great struggle
for independence.	-- Attributed to Charles Austin Beard (1874-1948)
