<PRE>Hi.

First, thanks for providing gpsd, very useful.

I am not a good C programmer, otherwise I would do it myself and send a patch, 
so here goes for a feature request.

I have the need for a copy of the serial data (in NMEA format) of the GPS 
device. Besides the computer use of the GPS data I have a second device which 
would like to be fed with NMEA data (a radio, like in Ham Radio and APRS).

Currently the GPS receiver is connected to a serial port and used by gpsd, who 
switches it to binary mode (it's a Sirf device). Ok, I know I can prevent the 
binary mode being used, and I could probably play with 'tee' and some 
creative redirecting to get a copy of the serial data. 

The obvious solution would be to put a second GPS device on the roof, they 
don't cost much. But that would require laying yet another cable (there are 
already 11 cables to my roof).

So I wonder if it wouldn't be easier to have gpsd send out a copy of the 
serial data over a second serial port. I understand that that will introduce 
a delay, so the copied data stream is probably not good for precision timing 
etc. But that's ok for my needs, I just want to have position, it does not 
matter that the data may be a second or so delayed.

Feasible? Interesting enough to be done somewhen?

Cheers,
Ekki (DF4OR)
