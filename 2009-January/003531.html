<PRE>Once upon a time, Chris Kuethe &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-users">chris.kuethe at gmail.com</A>&gt; said:
&gt;<i> that's not good... seems like your gps isn't chatty enough. last time
</I>&gt;<i> i saw that, a broken serial driver was involved.
</I>
I have ntpd running on the same port, getting a signal just fine, so I
don't think there's a problem like that.

As for not being chatty; when I was running that debug last night, I had
half an inch of rain falling (the antenna is sitting in a window that
doesn't have a particularly great view of the sky), so it probably just
didn't have a lock.  This morning it is plenty chatty.

&gt;<i> does it work if you build a gpsd with only the trimble driver and a
</I>&gt;<i> fixed speed of 9600bps?
</I>
Well, with 2.38rc1, I couldn't disable the NMEA or GPSClock drivers (got
a compile error).  I build with those and TSIP, and fixed to 9600, and
still no go.

It isn't just the speed that's a problem; it never tries to switch
parity.  I think part of the problem is that it gets the first byte of a
packet (0x10) right, because the serial driver ignores the extra parity
bit (actually, odd parity would be a 1 for 0x10, which the serial port
would treat as a stop bit).  gpsd sees 0x10 and starts looking for TSIP
(in packet.c, which doesn't shift parity settings), and it goes bad from
there, since now all you get is garbage (off-by-one at the bit level and
getting worse with each byte).

I don't speak for anybody but myself - that's enough trouble.
