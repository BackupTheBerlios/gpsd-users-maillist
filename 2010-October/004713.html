version 2.95


&gt;<i> &gt; I am also using a Trimble Placer 450 GPS receiver that is configured to

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; notification regarding the use of new GPS receivers and if this is not the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; correct forum to do so, please let me know.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I see that is not on our hardware page.  Please fill out this form:

</I>&gt;<i><A HREF="https://www.mainframe.cx/cgi-bin/gps_report.cgi">https://www.mainframe.cx/cgi-bin/gps_report.cgi</A>
</I>
I completed the form but when I sent it, I received an error:
Can't use string (&quot;berlios.de&quot;) as an ARRAY ref while &quot;strict refs&quot; 
in use at /var/www/cgi-bin/gps_report.cgi line 40.

I reported the error to <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-users">root at mainframe.cx</A> as requested but I don't 
know if the gps_report was accepted.


&gt;<i> &gt; If the antenna is disconnected, the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; time in the GLL, GGA and RMC sentences stops advancing as the data reported
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; becomes stale. The time in the ZDA sentence continues to advance.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Ugly.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This creates a problem for ntpd as gpsd reports the time in all 4 
</I>&gt;<i> sentences to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ntpd as the current time of day.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Odd, does the NMEA still report the fix as valid?
</I>
Yes, NMEA GSA reports a 2D fix while, in the same sentence, reports 0 
satellites, and that seemed odd to me. I expected no fix if no 
satellite signals are being received.


&gt;<i> &gt; Ntpd sees this as time running backwards and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; becomes very confused.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>gpsd tries to never report time to ntpd if the GPS reports no fix.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This problem was corrected by modifying the source code
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (driver_nmea.c) to report only the time in the ZDA sentence to ntpd.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>That will not work as a general solution.  Many GPS do not send a 
</I>&gt;<i>ZDA sentence.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Better is to find a way to not report the bad times to ntpd.but allow them to
</I>&gt;<i>be used when valid.
</I>
The code modification was a work-around for my case, I understand it 
would not be acceptable as a general solution. Maybe gpsd should 
require a fix and signal from 1 or more satellites, for the Placer 
450. I don't know if reporting a fix with 0 satellites is typical of 
Trimble NMEA capable receivers.

&gt;<i> &gt; I also noticed a daily cycle in the time offset data (loopstats) from ntpd,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; almost 200 us peak-peak. Does anyone know if this performance is typical?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Your PPS should be stable to around 1uS depending on several factors it
</I>&gt;<i>could be 2x or 3x better or worse.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I suspect the PPS is stable, but your system clock is not.  Daily fluctuations
</I>&gt;<i>in the temperature of your motherboard clock cam easily be in the 10mS range
</I>&gt;<i>or more if left uncorrected.  Things like room temperature, airflow, sunlight,
</I>&gt;<i>CPU load factor can easily swing the local clock.  That is why we use gpsd
</I>&gt;<i>and ntpd to discipline the local clock.
</I>
I have been plotting loopstats data with CPU load, line voltage and 
number of satellites in view to try to determine the cause of the 
clock variation. I see only a small correlation with CPU load and I 
assume it is due to the latency between a DCD change and the return 
from the select() call.

Thanks for your help.

Regards,
Bruce
