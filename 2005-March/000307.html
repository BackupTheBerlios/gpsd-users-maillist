<PRE>I should have called this &quot;the mess near uncertainty reporting&quot;.

One of my goals has been to report an uncertainty along with every
dimension of PVT, so that the return from the GPS actually (and
realistically) describes the volume of kinematic state space within
which it is located at 95% confidence.

There are several problems with this. 

A. I don't know how to derive or estimate uncertainty of time in the
general case.  There are clock drift and bias fields in the SiRF
binary protocol, but I don't know how to interpret these.  Does
anyone?

B. Only the Garmin reports estimated position error in meters, and I
don't know whether its confidence level is 50% or 95%.  Does anyone?
Gary?

C. SiRF binary reports HDOP, SiRF and other NMEA devices report
HDOP/VDOP/PDOP.

Here is what I am presently doing in the new E command:

1. I pass up the Garmin PGRME fields (uncertainty in meters) if
   they're available.

2. Otherwise, I apply the error model described in gpsd.h:

/*
 * User Equivalent Range Error
 * UERE is the square root of the sum of the squares of individual
 * errors.  We compute based on the following error budget for
 * satellite range measurements.  Note: this is only used if the
 * GPS doesn't report estimated position error itself.
 *
 * From R.B Langley's 1997 &quot;The GPS error budget&quot;. 
 * GPS World , Vol. 8, No. 3, pp. 51-56
 *
 * Atmospheric error -- ionosphere                 7.0m
 * Atmospheric error -- troposphere                0.7m
 * Clock and ephemeris error                       3.6m
 * Receiver noise                                  1.5m
 * Multipath effect                                1.2m
 *
 * From Hoffmann-Wellenhof et al. (1997), &quot;GPS: Theory and Practice&quot;, 4th
 * Ed., Springer.
 *
 * Code range noise (C/A)                          0.3m
 * Code range noise (P-code)                       0.03m
 * Phase range                                     0.005m
 *
 * Taking the square root of the sum of aa squares...
 * UERE=sqrt(7.0^2 + 0.7^2 + 3.6^2 + 1.5^2 + 1.2^2 + 0.3^2 + 0.03^2 + 0.005^2)
 *
 * See <A HREF="http://www.seismo.berkeley.edu/~battag/GAMITwrkshp/lecturenotes/unit1/">http://www.seismo.berkeley.edu/~battag/GAMITwrkshp/lecturenotes/unit1/</A>
 * for discussion.
 *
 * DGPS corrects for atmospheric distortion, ephemeris error, and satellite/
 * receiver clock error.  Thus:
 * UERE =  sqrt(1.5^2 + 1.2^2 + 0.3^2 + 0.03^2 + 0.005^2)
 */
#define UERE_NO_DGPS	8.1382
#define UERE_WITH_DGPS	1.9444
#define UERE(session)	((session-&gt;dsock==-1) ? UERE_NO_DGPS : UERE_WITH_DGPS)

What non-Garmin GPSes will return in the E command is UERE multiplied
by PDOP/HDOP/VDOP.  Annoyingly, SiRF binary mode only offers HDOP, the
one respect in which it is functionally inferior to SiRF NMEA.

I don't know, because my sources didn't say, whether the above is a
50%-confidence or 95%-confidence error budget.  My educated guess
is the latter, and that's what the gpsd documentation now says, but
it needs to be confirmed.

3. I don't currently pass back uncertainty of speed or track at
all, though SiRF chips make those available.  To do so would 
require yet another protocol extension, which gets into our
final issue (&quot;Does the GPSD protocol need to be redesigned?&quot;).

This area needs some attention from somebody who cares a lot about
GPS accuracy and is willing to do research on error budgets to pin
down the numbers and confidence levels.

Still to come:

* HAL integration

* DGPS/WAAS/EGNOS/SBAS support

* Multi-session semantics

* Subsecond polling

* Does the GPSD protocol need to be redesigned?
