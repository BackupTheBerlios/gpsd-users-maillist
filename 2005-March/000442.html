<PRE>Hi, from a new subscriber

I'm playing with a new SL-C3000, and I bought it with a Billionton CF GPS 
card. I've so far got as far as putting the zgcc compiler suite release 2.02 
on the Zaurus, and I've built gpsd and got it (half) running. The other half 
will come when I work out, or when anyone can tell me, what device to point 
/dev/gsp at... But that question's probably better suited to a 3000 forum.

However, I thought a post of my experience in building gpsd on that platform 
might be of interest to someone, so here goes. I was compiling from the 2.19 
source tarball.

The first issue on the Z is that its /tmp and /home directories are in very 
small partitions, and the build fills first one, then the other. To get 
around the /tmp problem was painful, because /tmp is a read-only symlink to 
/dev/shm/tmp. But the hard disc's partition 2 is large, and I found this 
worked in order to create a new tmp:

# Do this once
su
cd /hdd2
cp -a tmp tmp2
# Note: /hdd2/tmp does already exist, and seems to be used for
# something, though it's not the same as /tmp. The cp -a
# creates a new directory with the right attributes.

# Do this after the above, and after every reboot
# (because the reboot will restore the original /tmp)
su
rm -rf /hdd2/tmp2/*
cp -a /tmp/* /hdd2/tmp2/
mount -o bind /hdd2/tmp2 /dev/shm/tmp

Disclaimer: My Z is running with its original Qtopia and ROM. Installation of 
anything different may invalidate the above, and anyway I take no 
responsibility if you use it and your Z becomes a brick... I certainly 
haven't yet tested this over a long period.

For the /home limitation, that one's easy. Just do the build in a directory on 
/hdd2.

Next issue: autogen isn't present on the C3000. I could have installed it, but 
I found that

./configure 2&gt;&amp;1 | tee configure.mylog
make 2&gt;&amp;1 | tee make.mylog

worked, except that:

1. There were a number of compiler warnings &quot;cast increases required alignment 
of target type&quot;. I ignored them, and am hoping they won't come back and bite 
me. But are they routine? If not, maybe I should look further.

2. The compiler gave an error in libgpsd_core.c, at line 320. This is a 
declaration of intfixtime, and the compiler didn't like it because there were 
a couple of statements above it. I moved the declaration to the start of the 
block, leaving the initialisation part where it was.

3. At line 20 of sirfmon.c is the line
#include &lt;curses.h&gt;
With zgcc, that needs to be
#include &lt;ncurses/curses.h&gt;

Hope that's helpful

John
