<PRE>With all the commands currently implemented, only the following 
letters are left: ghjkno.  Multi-session, if implemented, will
eat a few of those.  

These are symptoms.  The underlying problem is that gpsd does a lot
more and has a more complex interface than it used to.  The protocol
design is getting visibly strained, especially by the new control
commands F and B.

It's going to get worse.  There isn't enough namespace left to report
all the kinds of kinematic uncertainty we want to, at least not
without gracelessly dumping a bunch of unrelated information via a
single response.

Another reason to think about a protocol redesign is that the existing
protocol reflects the quirks of NMEA all too faithfully.  This is more
obvious now that we support SiRF and Garmin binary.  Indeed, fidelity
to the NMEA model now limits our ability to report things like 
course drift.

It has a more subtle bad effect as well. The chunk size of what gpsd
passes up is wrong.  You can easily end up, for example, with an
altitude that has a different timestamp than your latitude/longitude,
even though they were actually derived from the same fix, simply
because the responses were shipped at different times.

Maybe it's time to think about a redesign.  Matters would be helped
by the existence of libgps; applications can link to that rather
than supplying their own parser.

Considered abstractly, what we really want a GPS to report is a
13-element vector describing an uncertainty volume in kinematic space:

time, timerr     = timestamp, estimated time error
lat, lon, alt    = latitude, longitude, altitude
herr, verr       = horizontal and vertical position error
speed, speederr  = groundspeed and groundspeed error
track, trackerr  = course over ground and course error
climb, climberr  = climb/sink and climb/sink error

Perhaps the protocol should be redesigned to ship these tuples,
assembling them where needed from sentences shipped in the same GPS
cycle (e.g. reporting the same fix).

Never could an increase of comfort or security be a sufficient good to be
bought at the price of liberty.		-- Hillaire Belloc
