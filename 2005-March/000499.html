Indeed.  On page 196 of K&amp;R, they write &quot;Fields are assigned
right-to-left on the PDP-11, left-to-right on other machines.&quot;  K&amp;R2nd
says &quot;The ANSI standard makes fields even more implementation-
dependent than did the first edition.&quot;  In other words, you start off
losing if you try to impose structs on external data.

 &gt; Naive me, I thought all C programmers knew this stuff.  Are you
 &gt; relatively new to the language?

No, he's not, unfortunately.  His misteak is widespread.  Look at the
htons and ntohs abortion.  They violate every rule of intelligent
identifier composition.  They're about as STOOPID (and consequently,
using them is as stupid) as the combination disk and tape drive that I
used at HP back in 1982.  The tape was as big as the disk, and so you
could back up the entire disk on the tape, or restore the disk from
the tape.  The process for doing this was to open the door, insert the
tape, and then press one of two levers labelled &quot;tape -&gt; disk&quot; and
&quot;disk -&gt; tape&quot;.  You're guessing, just about at this point, that I had
the painful experience of restoring instead of backing up.  Better
names would have been &quot;littleendian&quot; and &quot;bigendian&quot;, but that doesn't
fix their semantics.  That just makes it less likely that they'll be
interchanged.  It doesn't address the problem of when they should be
used and when not.

You don't need them if you access structured data correctly, by
offset, and by byte.

Now, if the compiler understood how to map structured data into native
values, that would be a different thing.  C put out a foot in that
direction with the :fieldwidth specification.  But that doesn't
address the direction of allocation of fields, nor byte offsets, nor
endian issues.
