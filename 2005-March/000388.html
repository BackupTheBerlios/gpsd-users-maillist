<PRE>Deep in the recesses of my brain, back in the dusty corner where I
keep API details I haven't cared about in fifteen years, something is
stirring...

Serial port opens normally hang if you don't specify O_NONBLOCK and
the port isn't connected to a live device, don't they?

I think I managed to forget this because it's been so damn long since
I did any serial programming, and evidently serial-over-USB devices do
*not* have this property.

Willem, try putting O_NONBLOCK in the open options in serial.c. If that
works, I think I may just have won the dumbass award.  Or maybe I'm
approaching senility and should switch to a job where idiocy actually
pays off, like (say) politics.
