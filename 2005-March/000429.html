<PRE>(Copied to the lists because there is a design issue here on which I would
like other peoples' inputs.)

Daniele Giangrazi &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-users">daniele.giangrazi at elital.net</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> &gt; Are you trying to say that gpsd gets an incorrect date if the D command
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; happens to come at a bad place in the update cycle?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, if the GPRMC sentence arrives before GPGGA the date supplied by GPRMC
</I>&gt;<i> is overwritten with the fake date.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If so, between what two sentences is the window of vulnerability?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The vulnerability is after the arrival of GPGGA and before the arrival of
</I>&gt;<i> GPRMC.
</I>&gt;<i> In this period the date memorized is the fake date.
</I>&gt;<i> My receiver send always GPRMC and then GPGGA therefore I have always the
</I>&gt;<i> fake date with XGPS.
</I>
I understand now.  But I am not sure there is any cure for this that would
not be worse than the disease.  I think instead this will turn into a FAQ 
entry.

The fundamental problem is that NMEA 0183 does not supply full dates.
Three sentences in the repertoire gpsd recognizes conntain date
fields; GPGGA/GPGLL date fields supply hhmmss.ss (with the trailing
.ss part optional), GPRMC adds ddmmyy but gives only a two-digit year
lacking a century part.  You can deduce the reason for this from the
fact that NMEA 0183 was specified for 4800bps; it was designed when
serial bandwidth was scarce and precious.

For various reasons including time display on clients, it is desirable
for gpsd to complete these dates.  The century part is never given and
hast to be faked from host-machine time (fortunately this could only 
cause problems about once ever hundred years).  The time of day is 
always given.  The remaining issue is how to fake up ddmmyy.

There are two possible strategies gpsd could use: (1) fill ddmmyy in
from the host machine's computation of GMT, or (2) copy it from the
last GPRMC. 

(1) has the benefit that it produces correct timestamps for GGA and
GLL in case they show up before GPRMC.  (2) has the benefit that it
will produce correct timestamps after the first GPRMC even if the system
clock is badly mis-set

(1) has the downside that it doesn't cope well with a mis-set system clock.
(2) has at least two downsides: (A) it won't put good timestamps in
GPGGA/GPGLL that show up before first GPRMC, (B) it may also put the
wrong date in a GLL or GGA collected within a cycle after midnight.

Presently gpsd uses (1).  I don't see that switching would really
improve matters
