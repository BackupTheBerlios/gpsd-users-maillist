<PRE>Well,

two things:

* Setting static navigation mode didn't change anything :( Still I go
much too fast and still there is only vertical movement on the map
(means, logitude doesn't change but latitude does)

* the good thing is that the latitude seems to be correct! I was driving
around a bit today and saw that the pointer moved accordingly to north
and south as it should.

I did &quot;gpsd -N -D 4 -p/dev/ttyUSB0 &gt; file 2&amp;&gt; file&quot; before starting my
journey and here is the output (not everything of it, you don't want to
read 500kb data, do you?)

Thanks,

Tobias
