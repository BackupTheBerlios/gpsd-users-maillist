<PRE>I have spotted an opportunity to drastically simplify the library
interface.  It depends on being able to assign a single timestamp 
to all the components of a fix -- even when it's reported through
multiple NMEA sentences.

So I eyeballed the log from one of my SiRF GPSes.

$GPGGA,202730.584,4002.1057,N,07531.2053,W,1,05,1.4,140.0,M,-33.8,M,0.0,0000*4C
$GPGLL,4002.1057,N,07531.2053,W,202730.584,A*2A
$GPGSA,A,3,10,26,21,08,06,,,,,,,,2.4,1.4,2.0*3B
$GPRMC,202730.584,A,4002.1057,N,07531.2053,W,0.00,47.44,150305,,*2C

If we group these by timestamp, it looks like the basic cycles break
up like this:

-- fix computed --
$GPGGA,202730.584,4002.1057,N,07531.2053,W,1,05,1.4,140.0,M,-33.8,M,0.0,0000*4C

$GPRMC,202730.584,A,4002.1057,N,07531.2053,W,0.00,47.44,150305,,*2C
$GPVTG,0.00,T,,M,0.00,N,0.0,K*60

$GPRMC,202731.584,A,4002.1055,N,07531.2052,W,0.00,47.44,150305,,*2E
$GPVTG,0.00,T,,M,0.00,N,0.0,K*60
-- fix computed --
$GPGGA,202732.584,4002.1053,N,07531.2050,W,1,05,1.4,142.0,M,-33.8,M,0.0,0000*4B
$GPGLL,4002.1053,N,07531.2050,W,202732.584,A*2F
$GPGSA,A,3,10,26,21,08,06,,,,,,,,2.4,1.4,2.0*3B
$GPRMC,202732.584,A,4002.1053,N,07531.2050,W,0.00,47.44,150305,,*29
$GPVTG,0.00,T,,M,0.00,N,0.0,K*60

That is, it looks like GGA is the first report issued each cycle.

Are there any exceptions to this?  I'm particularly interested in
hearing from people with non-SiRF GPS engines -- FV18s, iBLoxes 
and the like.  Tell me what your GPS does.

And if your GPS ever seems to report different timestamps for
sentences in the same cycle, I need to know that too.

You [should] not examine legislation in the light of the benefits it will
convey if properly administered, but in the light of the wrongs it
would do and the harm it would cause if improperly administered
