Howdy all I am Gene &quot;man am I going fast&quot; Imes and my gps is a holux 
GR230 and I don't believe it has XTrac. And if you have read the 'man am 
I going fast' thread you will notice that my gps as indicated that I 
have been driving well over a 1000 mph which as before I swear I kept it 
under a 1000. Follows some specs on the GR230:


1. Wireless GPS using bluetooth wireless technology

2. Communicate with Host Platform via bluetooth Serial Profile

3. SiRF Star II/LP high performance and low power consumption chipset

4. All-in-view 12-channel parallel processing

5. Built-in WAAS/EGNOS Demodulator without any additional hardware.

6. Support NMEA0183 v2.2 data protocol or SiRF binary code

7. 4 color LED showing: Bluetooth , Navigation Update and Battery and 
Charger Status Indication

8. FLASH based program memory. Firmware upgradeable through serial interface

9. Water resistant

10. Support Windows, Mac OS 10.x, Linux, Pocket PC and Palm device with 
Bluetooth or USB host capability.

By the way does anyone have any insight as to what is better XTrac or WAAS?

Thanks,
