<PRE>Hi list,

I did an outdoor test today with my BU-303 usb gps receiver. gpsd was
version 2.19 and the gpsdrive I used was 2.09, in parallel I had xgps
running for doublecheck.
Well. I have two major problems here:

* gpsdrive reported insanely high speeds. I certainly do NOT own a car
that can do 1400 kms/h :)
Best thing is, at the same time xgps reported 0.0 miles/h which was also
definitely wrong, I was driving at about 60 kms/h.

* gpsdrive only shows vertical movement, but no horizontal. Also,
vertical movement is incorrect, the pointer jumps up and down. I cannot
tell if the coordinates shown in xgps were adequate, I was alone and had
to keep an eye on the road ;)

However, I managed to do two screenshots, the first one shows gpsdrive
reporting insane speeds and the mentioned vertical movement, the second
one shows xgps reporting zero speeds while gpsdrive reports lightning-
fast speeds (done while doing 60 kms/h). 

I know that this is gpsd-users, so I will be posting this to the
gpsdrive mailing list also; but alone the fact that xgps reports zero
while driving is probably worth your attention.

I have also seen more than one complaints about wrong &amp; crazy speeds, so
it might be possible that my gps unit is not broken :)


Thanks for your time and for reading,

Tobias.
