<PRE>WARNING - A NOVEL FOLLOWS  :^)

I describe my environment/setup, review the GPS unit, summarize my 
testing, list the details of how/what I tested, list ideas for the 
cause of connectivity problem, and ask for HELP/IDEAS/FUTURE TESTING.

I am working with the following setup:

Computer/Build environment:
Mac 17&quot; 1.33 Powerbook, Mac mini 1.44, &amp; G5 1.8DP, all w/Bluetooth
All Mac OS X 10.3.8, latest updates
gcc version 3.3 20030304 (Apple Computer, Inc. build 1666)
	No gcc optimization or compile flags
	Building from the command line with:
		./configure
		make
		make sirfcom
		sudo make install
	Builds &amp; installs successfully, without any errors or issues.

GPS:
Ambicom Air2Net Bluetooth GPS Navigation System:
	<A HREF="http://www.ambicom.com/products/air2net/bt-gps.html">http://www.ambicom.com/products/air2net/bt-gps.html</A>
Which is actually a Leadtek GPS 9537 Bluetooth GPS Receiver
	<A HREF="http://www.leadtek.com/gps/gps_9537_1.html">http://www.leadtek.com/gps/gps_9537_1.html</A>
	<A HREF="http://www.leadtek.com/gps/gps_9537_2.html">http://www.leadtek.com/gps/gps_9537_2.html</A>
	It even says Leadtek 9537 on the unit, with NO mention of Ambicom!
	I believe several other companies re-badge this unit
		I've seen several GPS's with the same spec's &amp;
		identical LED's/buttons/connectors/markings/layout
Uses Bluetooth Serial Protocol
	Conflicting documentation states:
		NMEA @ 4800bps, 8N1
		NMEA @ 38400bps, 8N1
		With debug levels turned on, I've seen 4800, 9600 &amp; 38400 work...
NMEA-0183 v2.2 (I think I saw this version somewhere, in one of the 
utilities...)
Chipset - Sirf Star IIe/LP

Software tested with:
gpsd v2.17
sirfmon works MOST of the time.....
gpsd works SOME of the time.....
KisMAC direct to /dev/tty.gps works SELDOM.....
	<A HREF="http://binaervarianz.de/projekte/programmieren/kismac/">http://binaervarianz.de/projekte/programmieren/kismac/</A>
stty -f /dev/tty.gps -ispeed 4800 works RARELY/NEVER....
Windows based utility SiRFDemo.exe v3.61 works EVERY time......

A quick review of the unit:
It appears to lock VERY quickly, &lt; 40 seconds in worst conditions, and 
I've never seen it lose a lock, even in town.  It typically locks in a 
&lt; 10 seconds.  I've even had it lock indoors, near a small window!  (At 
least that's what the LED indicates.)
Bluetooth range SUCKS big time.  3'-5' line of site.  If anything is in 
between, the range drops significantly.  This was tested with three (3) 
different Bluetooth adapters (Apple Powerbook built-in, d-link &amp; 
Belkin), a PocketPC &amp; Palm Tungsten T.
Unit has Lithium battery that lasts ~7 hours.  The battery is a cell 
phone type, and user replaceable.  The units works without a battery, 
if power cord is used.
Ambicom version comes with battery, US AC adapter, Car adapter &amp; 
software for Windows &amp; PocketPC - Retail ~$220.
Leadtek version (EXACT unit, maybe even a newer, HS-High Sensitivity, 
version) comes with battery, US AC adapter, Non-US Plugs for AC 
adapter, Car adapter &amp; No software - Online ~$130.
Built-in ceramic patch antenna
External antenna connector (conflicting information - MC or MMC?)
Charging/Power Jack
Bluetooth status LED
Sat. Lock/Charging status LED
Power Button
Dimensions:  83mm x 45mm x 18mm
Weight:  52g w/o Battery, 78g w/Battery

Testing summary:
The Auto baud-rate/bits/parity/driver detection in gpsd USUALLY does 
NOT work.  When it does work, the unit works GREAT with gpsd, KisMAC 
w/gpsd &amp; sirfmon.  sirfmon Auto detection appears to work more 
reliably.  I keep mentioning sirfmon, because it allows me to set the 
GPS output mode and baud rate.  If sirfmon detects the unit and works, 
I can set the baud rate to 4800, and gpsd works almost every time.  
gpsd has recognized the unit as both a generic NMEA &amp; SiRF unit, I 
think, depending on how I've set it with sirfmon, when exiting sirfmon.

Testing detail &amp; observations:
The unit is quickly found by the Bluetooth adapter for pairing.  I pair 
the unit easily and successfully on any device/adapter I've tried.  I 
then set up a serial port, that does not use security, or require 
authentication.  The serial port is defined as an &quot;Outgoing&quot; port, and 
named '/dev/tty.gps'.  The Mac has a GUI to do this, called &quot;Bluetooth 
Serial Utility&quot;.  When using 'stty', 'gpsd', 'sirfmon', 'cat 
/dev/tty.gps' or KisMAC (directly to /dev/tty.gps), the Bluetooth 
serial port is connected automatically.  'cat /dev/tty.gps' usually 
spits out data - typically NOT ASCII.  When trying to use 'stty' to set 
the serial port speed ('stty -f /dev/tty.gps -ispeed 4800'), it usually 
fails (I don't think I've ever seen it work, but I've done so much 
testing, I won't swear to it.)  The error message is:  &quot;I NEED TO 
LOOKUP THE ERROR MESSAGE&quot;.  The speed is reported back as 9600, no 
matter what I try to set it to.  'stty -f /dev/tty.gps' almost always 
reports the speed at 9600, UNLESS 'gpsd', 'sirfmon', or KisMAC are 
running and working correctly.  If 'gpsd', 'sirfmon', or KisMAC 
(directly to the /dev/tty.gps, not using gpsd) are working correctly, 
then the speed is usually reported as 4800.  I've run gpsd with '-N 
-D6' and added my own debugging output.  If gpsd is NOT going to work, 
it hangs in 'packet.c', at function packet_sniff(), in the 'for' loop 
near lines 404-425 (the line numbers may be a little off, with my 
additional debugging code), and hammers my CPU, until I kill gpsd.  The 
variable 'count' never gets changed from 0.  If I add a 'count = 1 ;' , 
at the end of the 'for' loop, just before the brace, it does step 
through SNIFF_RETRIES packets, before returning.  I don't fully 
understand what's happening in the 'for' loop, so this may NOT be a 
good thing.  I wonder if there is a bug in packet_sniff()?  I've tried 
upping SNIFF_RETRIES, and it doesn't seem to help.  After I added the 
'count = 1;', it does step through ALL the baud rate/bit combinations.  
It just never finds a working combination.  I've hacked up both gpsd &amp; 
sirfmon, to only try single buad rates.  If they don't auto detect, I 
can usually get at least sirfmon to work at 38400 (hacked to only use 
that baud rate.)  Then I use sifrmon to change the baud rate to 4800, 
and then gpsd works.  I do think the failures of gpsd, KisMAC &amp; sirfmon 
occur most often, when the GPS unit is inside, and without a lock.  
This is NOT always the case - I have had it fail outside, in an open 
horizon, with a lock indication.  Throughout all of this testing, I 
have tried turning the GPS on and off at various times, to &quot;reset&quot; it.  
The documentation mentions NO method of officially reseting the GPS - 
hold the power button for .5 seconds to turn on, and hold the power 
button for 3 seconds to turn off.  I have observed that if the GPS is 
off, and you hold the power button for too long, it will NOT turn on.  
If the GPS unit is on, and you hold the power button for too long, it 
will NOT turn off.  I have tried removing the battery, but I believe 
the unit has an internal battery for keeping some satellite data.  I 
didn't notice any effect on my testing, after removing the battery, to 
try and reset the unit.

As I mentioned earlier, I've used a Windows based tool from the 
chip-set manufacturer, SiRFDemo.exe, and it works EVERY time.

I haven't come to any definite conclusion as to where the problem is.  
Here are some possibilities/ideas:
1 - The GPS unit gets into STRANGE modes/states, and doesn't respond 
appropriately to commands or baud rate changes
2 - The GPS unit is broken or poorly implemented
3 - The GPS unit's Bluetooth implementation SUCKS
4 - Weak Bluetooth signal strength is causing communication issues
5 - Bluetooth serial devices on the Mac don't respond correctly to baud 
rate change requests properly
6 - Bug in gpsd auto detect code

I would be glad to do some additional testing or coding, if anyone has 
any ideas/recommendations.  If someone can explain the packet_sniff() 
function and what's happening in it &amp; get_packet, I'll look into it.  
If someone knows of a Bluetooth sniffer for Mac or Windows, I would be 
glad to sniff the traffic between the Windows machine and the GPS unit 
when using SiRFDemo.exe.  I do have a couple of Linux (Gentoo) systems 
(my servers), but I haven't used the Bluetooth adapters with them.  
They are servers for my house and family, and the family expects them 
to be on and work all the time....  ;^)  I might install Linux on 
another available box, if someone thinks it will help troubleshooting.

I plan to return the Ambicom unit (in about a week), and probably 
purchase the Leadtek unit, with an external antenna ($20 extra).  I 
really like the size and GPS locking ability of this unit.  I just need 
to get it reliably connecting with a Mac &amp; gpsd.  If anyone has any 
recommendations for a comparable Bluetooth GPS unit, they've had work 
with a Mac, works with gpsd, has an external antenna port and can be 
powered by the vehicle, please let me know.

Thanks for reading my novel,
Frank
