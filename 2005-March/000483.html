 &gt; &gt; Offsets are how the data is presented to you off the network,

 &gt; 
 &gt; Correct, and we use reads to get back strings of bytes.  But the data
 &gt; in the packet is logically a structure.  So it is easier and less
 &gt; error promne to use the structures.

Not in my experience.  The old earthmate.c code had structs and it did
not work correctly.  I took them out and replaced them with offsets,
and the code worked properly.  I'm not some kind of godlike error-free
creature.  I've just found that some methods generate fewer mistakes;
that some types of coding can more easily be seen to be correct.

 &gt; Yes and no.  If the compiler packs the structure and the item size
 &gt; is strictly specified, then it too is consistent across machine
 &gt; architecture.

Programming for the ARM processor quickly disabuses you of this
notion.  All the world's not a VAX.

 &gt; Do some rooting around in the glibc code and you will see they
 &gt; agree with me.

If you're wrong, pointing to other people who are also wrong is no
help.  There's a lot of code in the Linux kernel written by people who
agree with you.  They, too, are wrong.  The people who wrote the
garmin library are also wrong.  Streams of data organized into packets
need to be marshalled into structs, not cast into structs.  You can't
vote on reality; you can only recognize it.  You can't vote on
scientific principles; you can only discover them.
