The gcc docs don't seem to mention that pragma, but __attribute__ ((packed)) 
made no difference. I had thought it was a question of aligning the start 
address of the whole character array, but I've tried that, and it made no 
difference either. I agree with Eric's view: the compiler is simply being 
over-picky.

It's not an issue for me: the C3000 has an Arm processor like other models, 
and I don't know of any architectural issues. I made the original post only 
because I saw nothing in the archive about building on that platform so I 
thought maybe it'd be helpful to record the experience.

Gspd does run, but I can't prove it works yet because I haven't been able to 
get any output from the card, even using the stty method in the INSTALL 
document. When I solve that one, I'll hopefully be able to report success!

&gt;<i> BTW, do you know if libusb runs on your target?  Not implemented, but in
</I>&gt;<i> the noodling stage, is support for libusb instead of native kernel drivers.
</I>
Ah, now that's a good one. What I know about libusb is approximately zero, and 
I'm not sure whether you mean 'is running' or 'would run'. I can tell you 
that I can't find a file whose name begins with libusb in the 
LD_LIBRARY_PATH: does that answer the question, or do you have another 
suggestion as to how I can tell?

Cheers

John
