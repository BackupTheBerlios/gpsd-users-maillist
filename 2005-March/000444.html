<PRE>Hi all,

First I have to say I loved when I saw Eric's name on the archives,
now I know I am in _good_ company. (Although that was not exactly
news, since I knew Eric was working on gpsd).

I just joined the list, and contrary to netiquette I am posting my
first msg even before reading the archives, so...If I don't get any
answer, I'll consider my question proprely answered.
Please forgive me, as I do this from the excitement of seeing myself
in such good company.

I am Brazilian, having a degree in Geology, work as geophysicist, I am
also a ham (call PU2PIX), was in the scouts for more than 12 years. I
guess I have some familiarity with GPS devices....

I am considering my first GPS purchase. Being a big fan of Garmin, I
am considering the options between buying an eTrex Legend (the beaten
path) or a Leadtek 9532 (unproven ground).

This is a (big) bit off-topic, but I'll go anyway...  which I saw is
untested with gpsd, So, if anyone advises me in the Leadtek direction,
I should gladly test this device against gpsd and provide report to
you.
Otherwise, I'll go the garmin way.

I am yet undecided in this matter, because it seems the leadtek should
work both with the desktop and the palm, and also with a future
notebook. On the other hand, the standalone Legend is rugged and
waterproof. Since I intend to use the gps on the field, the garmin
seems very adequate.

BTW, Eric, I know a geodesist which could (probably) give good advice
on this GPS letter soup you mentioned on a previous message (march,
11, I think).
