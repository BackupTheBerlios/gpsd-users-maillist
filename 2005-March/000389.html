<PRE>&gt;<i> 1. gpsd is intended to be zero-configuration, launched by a hotplug
</I>&gt;<i> script  and automatically syncing up with whatever GPSes it finds. 
</I>&gt;<i> Adding a baud rate option would represent a step away from that, back
</I>&gt;<i> towards the bad old world  where users have to do more than just plug
</I>&gt;<i> the GPS into a handy port to make it work.  
</I>
for embedded gps applications time-to-fix is critical to keep power use
to minimum. e.g. I've built GPS-&gt;Satellite transmitters that run for yr+
on 15 D-cells. What about a /etc/gpsdrc file with which (if it exists) a
&quot;power user&quot;* can specify [Lock!!!] port/mode/baud rate? This file only
exists if you put it there, Aunt Tillie (below) is none the wiser.
See below for &quot;but it scans only once&quot; response.

[*] I wouldn't really call '-p /dev/ttyS1 -s 9600' &quot;power-usage&quot;

 
&gt;<i> 2. I may give gpsd the capability to handle multiple GPSes.  If that
</I>&gt;<i> happens, an -s option on the command line stops making a lot of sense.
</I>
Report from the field re. the use of multiple GPSs:

I know (personally) several different folks using multiple GPSs coming
back to a single logger. This has been for attitude observation on
container ships, development aircraft, and america's cup yachts.

I have never heard a suggestion of using multiple cheap GPS to get a
better fix for where you are*. I think it's a case of- you can have a
dozen TV sets all tuned into the same channel at once, but you are still
just watching the same crummy episode of Gilligan's Island. i.e. you can
improve the signal strength &amp; average out the different interpolation
models each receiver uses, but if you have 12-channel GPSs in the same
place you are still seeing all the same satellites in the sky and you
would be better off just using your best one.

[*] maybe it works great. Sounds like an EE MSc project for someone.
shrug.


&gt;<i> Remember, my typical use case is Aunt Tillie with a GPS mouse and a
</I>&gt;<i> laptop. I'm trying to ruthlessly simplify all interfaces.
</I>
a worthy goal.

&gt;<i> Considering time to first  fix and the fact that you usually pay the
</I>&gt;<i> hunt-time cost only once (when you  start up your application) I don't
</I>&gt;<i> think a second and a half of hunt time is much of a price for the
</I>&gt;<i> simplification.
</I>
mmph. I'm not sold.. &lt;devil's advocate&gt; if the gps powers down between
fixes, will gpsd rescan when next a connection is made? or is it sticky
for entire life of the process? What if the gpsd process is unloaded
when not in use, say in limited memory environments.

I'd rather it just obeyed my orders of where the gps should be and
didn't waste any more time/cycles/probing on the problem. Smart when
needed, sure, but obedient when instructed; and as light as possible.
K.I.S.S. works.

Hamish
