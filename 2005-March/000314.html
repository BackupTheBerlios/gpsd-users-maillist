The _interesting_ question is what does a GPS client generally want when it 
talks to gpsd?  To know where it is in the world, or to know which brand of 
GPS device it's using to get that information?

Every actual real world use of GPS I can think of boils down to &quot;tell me where 
I am&quot;.  That's what they're for.  If there's more than one device, then what 
these users want is either A) the first one, B) an average.  The whole point 
of this daemon is so I DON'T have to fiddle with the details of the device 
(or mediate contention with other users of the device), correct?  They just 
want to know where they are.

I realise that somebody somewhere may want to plug in two of them at different 
ends of an airplane to figure out whether it's pointing up or pointing down, 
but those people are asking a different question.  Not &quot;Where am I&quot;, but 
&quot;where is this set of GPS devices, which aren't in the same place and thus 
can't all be where I am&quot;.

Let 'em get their own daemon for that.  If 99% of your users just want &quot;tell 
me where I am&quot; (so I can automatically mark this wireless hotspot on a map 
without manual intervention while wardriving, so I can use my PDA as a 
pedometer, which way is the geocache, or for whatever reason) then that other 
1% shouldn't screw things up for the 99% who are asking a very simple 
question, over and over.

What's the old saying about the guy who has one watch always knowing what time 
it is, but the guy who has two never being sure?

Can of worms, Eric.  You'll notice you didn't get a user request for this, you 
got a guy who makes infrastructure thinking that this might someday be used 
because hey: he can make infrastructure for it!
