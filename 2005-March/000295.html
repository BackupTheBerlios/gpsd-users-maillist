Did you try it? Your post is unclear on this. If not, why not?

I wouldn't see much point in it, myself. In some cases, maybe. But you 
have not put forth a compelling argument, or offer of payment, here.

That's how free software works. A person has a need; he uses the tools 
which are available to fill that need; he shares that solution with the 
community; and we all benefit. For some people the only tools they can 
use are money, and that's fine. Pay someone to do it, share it, and 
again we all benefit.

Free software is not about freeloading. If your English is not good you 
might not be familiar with that term. A freeloader is someone who gets 
something without giving anything in return, like a parasite.

Once you get into the free software spirit, you're less likely to see 
any appeal in proprietary OS's. I sure don't.

BTW gpsd is a cross-platform tool. It should compile on any of hundreds 
of POSIX-compliant OS's. Perhaps you should talk to your OS vendor 
about supporting Cygwin, or providing and supporting their own POSIX 
layer?

Good luck, and please do report back with your Cygwin success.
