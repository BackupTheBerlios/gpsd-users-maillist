<PRE>I've been tracking releases since about November and have yet to have any 
success under Cygwin.  It can be beaten into compiling, but usually there 
are issues dealing with detecting the GPS's presence.

It may seem odd, but there is a need for GPSD under Cygwin, especially for 
anyone wanting to use Kismet under windows (more interest than you'd think. 
Since it's a network app too, it makes sense to be able to run it on 
multiple platforms.

Rob is quite right, it's a free project, so don't complain to much if it 
does do what you need it to.  You get what you pay for.

I did a presentation at Shmoocon last month and I hoped to get some interest 
from the audience about helping get GPSD working.  So far, nothing.  So I'll 
extend the bounty to here as well.

My $100 USD speaker honorarium to the GPSD project for cygwin support and 
maintenince.

Hopefully thats enough money where my mouth is.

</I>&gt;<i> Good luck, and please do report back with your Cygwin success.
