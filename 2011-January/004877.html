<PRE>Roger Oberholtzer &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-users">roger.oberholtzer at ramboll.se</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> 1. What are the minimum record types that gpsd needs to be able to
</I>&gt;<i> provide a fix? It seems to me that it is GGA and RMC. GGA alone is not
</I>&gt;<i> enough. Is this correct? The clients to gpsd that I am trying this with
</I>&gt;<i> are Navit and TangoGPS. Perhaps it is more a question of what they are
</I>&gt;<i> asking from gpsd?
</I>
GGA should be sufficient by itself, but I don't think that mode of gpsd
operation is well tested.  I don't know of any devices that emit GGA but
not RMC.

You might find rerading driver_nmea.c instructive.
 
&gt;<i> 2. I want to have the playback look somewhat realistic. With no options,
</I>&gt;<i> the locations are provided as fast as they are available. Which when
</I>&gt;<i> reading from a file means pretty quick. I have tried the -c option to
</I>&gt;<i> gpsfake. But I get unexpected results. I have a 10 Hz receiver, with 4
</I>&gt;<i> NMEA records per 'report'. That would mean 40 records per second. If I
</I>&gt;<i> specify -c 0.25, the reports seem to slow to a snail's pace. The
</I>&gt;<i> movement is in fact 50 km/h. I am guessing that I have misunderstood
</I>&gt;<i> something.
</I>
&gt;<i>From the manual page:
</I>
    The -c option sets the delay between sentences in
    seconds. Fractional values of seconds are legal.  The default is zero
    (no delay).

What part of this is difficult to understand?  If you're shipping 40
records per second, a delay of 0.25 will balloon a single second's output
to 10 seconds.  Of *course* it's slowed to a crawl; you'd need to drop 
the delay to 0.025 to approximate a 1-second-to-1-second mapping.
