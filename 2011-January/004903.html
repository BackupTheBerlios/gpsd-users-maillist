</I>&gt;<i> I'm the project lead. You are caught in a very unfortunate set of
</I>&gt;<i> circumstances. I'll explain.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The root of the problem is that the USB standard does not define a device

</I>&gt;<i> GPSD hotplug rules could simply say &quot;hand everything with that type to GPSD&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> But it doesn't, so we have to look at the device type and guess.
</I>
I understand that you're using a hack to fix a problem that someone else
made.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Actually, even if there were a GPS device class, it is more than
</I>&gt;<i> possible that the manufacturers of GPS mice wouldn't bother to make
</I>&gt;<i> the devices present it.  You see, most GPS mice are lash-ups
</I>&gt;<i> consisting of a receiver module that's interfaced by a sort of
</I>&gt;<i> bastardized TTL version of RS-232 with an RS-232-to-USB adaptor chip.
</I>&gt;<i> The USB device class is presented down the wire to your PC by the
</I>&gt;<i> adaptor chip, which would have to be custom-modified to show something
</I>&gt;<i> other than its *own* device class and vendor/product ID.  GPS mice are
</I>&gt;<i> manufactured on thin enough margins that the vendors probably wouldn't
</I>&gt;<i> pay for that.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So all we get to see is the class and vendor/product ID of the USB interface
</I>&gt;<i> chip.  The only way we can guess at &quot;is this a GPS?&quot; is by checking a list
</I>&gt;<i> of vendor/product codes of USB interface chips commonly used in GPSes and
</I>&gt;<i> throwing that device at gpsd if it matches.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, this does mean that if you're using a device that has one of these
</I>&gt;<i> chips in it that is not a GPS, you lose.  Sorry, we can't help that.  
</I>&gt;<i> We knew this failure mode was possible, but until you complained
</I>&gt;<i> (and yes, you're the first) it was theoretical. These USB chips are
</I>&gt;<i> not very commonly used for anything else - or if they are, the integrators
</I>&gt;<i> are being good citizens and changing the class/vendor/product ID to
</I>&gt;<i> something that tells USB what is behind them.
</I>
As for the &quot;the integrators are being good&quot;, I found out that they're
not. After removing the udev rules as you suggested and rebooting, there
was another program, modem-manager, trying to open the serial port and
writing to it... it looks like integrators of GSM usb sticks are at
least as careless as GPS mice integrators, and another open source
project is trying to work around that :(
So now I'm left with trying to remove this other program, but that's off
topic.

Curious, I've been using Linux for years, and there has never been
anything lurking at serial ports, it's probably the price for the &quot;plug
and play&quot; philosophy.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> At first I tried to simply &quot;yum remove gpsd&quot; but the whole KDE
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> environment seems to depend on it...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That's the other unfoertunate circumstance.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So, I'm asking if it is possible to disable gpsd without uninstalling it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (I'm not an expert of udev).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes.  Just perform the equivalent pg &quot;make udev-uninstall&quot;, removing
</I>&gt;<i> the udev rules file installed by GPSD. This means USB GPSes will no
</I>&gt;<i> longer hotplug, of course.
</I>
Thanks, make udev-uninstall worked.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> And lastly, despite I've read <A HREF="http://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=801">http://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=801</A> and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> discovered that dealing with GPSes is a mess, I still think that opening
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> automatically every USB/serial adapter and start sending data is a bit
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> invasive.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We don't actually do that.  When a hotplug event notifies gpsd about a
</I>&gt;<i> candidate device, the device path is stashed away and opned only when
</I>&gt;<i> a gpsd client actually requests data.
