<PRE>I have a Garmin X10 bluetooth GPS that I have been using with my Centro.
I now want to use it on my Fedora 14 laptop.

I found instructions to do the following to get bluetooth GPS access:

1. Create an /etc/bluetooth/rfcomm.conf entry:

rfcomm0 {
# Automatically bind the device at startup
bind yes;
# Bluetooth address
device 00:05:4F:08:91:16;
#RFCOMM channel for connection
channel 1;
#Description of the connection
comment &quot;GPS Garmin x10 #89116 Bluetooth&quot;;
}

2. Bind the rfcomm0 device to my GPS.

# rfcomm bind rfcomm0

3. I wrote a python script to send an add command to the gpsd driver. I
need for the gpsd driver to open the /dev/rfcomm0 for the GPS to connect

$ bluetooth_rfcomm add /dev/rfcomm0

After these steps the GPS shows as connected and gpsd finds it and I can
use xgps to see that it gets data. I also have driven around using
gpsdrive and tangogps and it all seems to work quite well.

The problem comes when I turn the GPS device off. The xgps routine gets
'0' data and that's expected. I then turn the GPS back on and xgps still
only sees '0' data.

To get gpsd to recognize the gps after it has been turned off I need to
take it off the gpsd list and add it back:

# bluetooth_rfcomm remove /dev/rfcomm0
# bluetooth_rfcomm add /dev/rfcomm0

Then I seem to be OK again.

I have tried using udev to make things automated using guidance from
this web page:

<A HREF="http://cris.bytesnblades.net/2009/02/20/starting-gpsd-automatically-with-a-bluetooth-gps">http://cris.bytesnblades.net/2009/02/20/starting-gpsd-automatically-with-a-bluetooth-gps</A>

What I have found in my experiments is that I have to unbind
the /dev/rfcomm0 device by using the release option to rfcomm in order
for udev to recognize the power off and walk through the udev rules with
a remove ACTION. So, even though this saves me the need for the first
time use of my command to add the GPS to gpsd's device list, I still
have the turn it off and back on problem.

It just seems like udev doesn't recognize the device has been turned off
until I release /dev/rfcomm manually.

How do I set things up so that when I turn off the GPS and turn it back
on gpsd will recognize that the GPS is available again without having to
perform any manual commands ?

I seem to be missing something with trying to get udev to do all the
work. Should I not do the bind and have udev call a script that uses
connect instead ? 

When I do:

# udevadm info -a
-p /devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1d.0/usb2/2-1/2-1.7/2-1.7:1.0/bluetooth/hci0/hci0:12/rfcomm0

  looking at device
'/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1d.0/usb2/2-1/2-1.7/2-1.7:1.0/bluetooth/hci0/hci0:12/rfcomm0':
    KERNEL==&quot;rfcomm0&quot;
    SUBSYSTEM==&quot;tty&quot;
    DRIVER==&quot;&quot;
    ATTR{address}==&quot;00:05:4F:08:91:16&quot;
    ATTR{channel}==&quot;1&quot;

  looking at parent device
'/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1d.0/usb2/2-1/2-1.7/2-1.7:1.0/bluetooth/hci0/hci0:12':
    KERNELS==&quot;hci0:12&quot;
    SUBSYSTEMS==&quot;bluetooth&quot;
    DRIVERS==&quot;&quot;
    ATTRS{type}==&quot;ACL&quot;
    ATTRS{address}==&quot;00:05:4F:08:91:16&quot;
    ATTRS{features}==&quot;0xffff8ffe9bf90080&quot;
&lt;more stuff&gt;

I have noticed that the hci0:12 directory in the devices path disappears
when I turn off the GPS even though /dev/rfcomm0 persists.

Can I use udev to try and &quot;do something&quot; when hci0:12 goes away to try
and get the right thing to happen ?

Comments, pointers suggestions recommended.

Thanks
Chris Kottaridis
