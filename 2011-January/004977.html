</I>
I really wanted to know what devices were on the list, just to verify
that my add worked correctly. Also, there were times when I was adding
and removing while monitoring various behavior and tunring the device on
and off and I had lost track of whether it was on the list when I fired
up the device or if I had removed it last. It would have been good to
get see the list to see whether it was on the list at that time or not.
Would have prevented lots of redos. It's a little thing, but I was
wishing for it multiple times.

I spent a little bit more time checking the behavior of rfcomm and how
it reconnects.

I think this may be able to be handled in gpsd without resorting to
udev to try and manage the connects and disconnects since udev events
don't seem to be generated when the device turns off.

The rfcomm bind seems to need an open to trigger the connection:

$ man rfcomm
bind &lt;dev&gt; [bdaddr] [channel]
    This  binds  the RFCOMM device to a remote Bluetooth device. The
    command did not establish a connection to the remote device,  it
    only  creates  the  binding.  The connection will be established
    right after an application tries to open the RFCOMM  device. 

I created a script:

#!/bin/bash
while /bin/true
do
  echo sleeping 5 seconds
  sleep 5
  echo cat /dev/rfcomm0
  cat /dev/rfcomm0
done

I run it starting with the GPS device off. I then indicate below when
I turn it on and back off:

# ./watcher.sh
sleeping 5 seconds
cat /dev/rfcomm0
cat: /dev/rfcomm0: Host is down
sleeping 5 seconds
&lt;turn device on&gt;
cat /dev/rfcomm0
$GPGGA,053557.314,,,,,0,00,,,M,0.0,M,,0000*51
$GPGSA,A,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,*1E
&lt;bunch of GPS commands&gt;
&lt;turn device off&gt;
$GPGSV,3,3,11,30,13,047,,08,13,276,,20,10,192,*4B
$GPRMC,053648.308,V,,,,,,,270111,,,N*4E
sleeping 5 seconds
cat /dev/rfcomm0
cat: /dev/rfcomm0: Host is down
sleeping 5 seconds
&lt;turn device back on&gt;
cat /dev/rfcomm0
$GPGGA,053726.721,,,,,0,00,,,M,0.0,M,,0000*57
$GPGSA,A,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,*1E
&lt;bunch of GPS commands&gt;
&lt;turn device off&gt;
$GPGSV,3,3,11,08,13,277,,30,13,047,,20,10,192,*4A
$GPRMC,053833.721,V,,,,,,,270111,,,N*43
sleeping 5 seconds
cat /dev/rfcomm0
cat: /dev/rfcomm0: Host is down
sleeping 5 seconds

Clearly, when I turn the device off it results in cat quitting, not
sure what file error it may be receiving. Then when the cat tries
to reopen the file when it gets started up when the device is on,
the open forces a reconnect and I get data again. If the device is
off when the script runs cat it waits for about 5 seconds or so and
then exits with the Host is down error.

So, as long as another open occurs after the gps has been turned back on
then it'll reconnect automatically.

I ran lsof -c gpsd to look at the files opened by gpsd. When I get it
connected up I see rfcomm0:

$ lsof -c gpsd
&lt;bunch o stuff&gt;
gpsd    1943 nobody   10u   CHR              216,0      0t0
242674 /dev/rfcomm0

When I turn the device off it no longer appears. The xgps shows:

{&quot;class&quot;:&quot;DEVICE&quot;,&quot;path&quot;:&quot;/dev/rfcomm0&quot;,&quot;activated&quot;:0}

Which I assume indicates a zero read which from the man page implies
that rcomm0 should be off the list. Since lsof doesn;t show /dev/rfcomm0
I assume the file has been closed. When I try and turn it on again it
still doesn't appear in th elsof output. Sending an add to the device
list also doesn't show it in lsof. Here is where list would have been
nice. According to the gpsd man page on the GPSD DEVICE MANAGEMENT
section when you get zero length data the device will be removed from
the list:

&gt;<i>A device may will also be dropped from the pool if GPSD gets a zero
</I>&gt;<i>length read from it. This end-of-file condition indicates that the'
</I>&gt;<i>device has been disconnected.
</I>
I would have thought that just doing an add through the control socket
would have triggered an open since it should have no longer been on
the list. But an add was not good enough. I have to send a remove and
then an add while the device is on again to get it to show in the
lsof output again. Having a &quot;list&quot; option would have been helpful
here. I assume it really is on the list after the zero read

It appears that when gpsd gets an error when the device goes off and it
closes /dev/rfcomm0, but never tries to open it again unless I send a
remove and an add when the device is on. I haven't looked at the gpsd
code yet to verify that, but from monitoring the behavior that seems
to be the way it works. I have to remove the device from the device
list and add it back to trigger gpsd to do an open of /dev/rfcomm0.

If the logic in gpsd would be to retry an open every so often after the
file gets closed due to the device being turned off, I think it would
re-establish connection all by itself.

Does that sound reasonable ?

Like I said I haven't gotten into the gpsd source code yet so maybe I
am off base somewhere.

Thanks
Chris Kottaridis
