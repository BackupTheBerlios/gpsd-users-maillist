<PRE>Danny Backx &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-users">danny.backx at scarlet.be</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> I'm a bit confused about this change vs. the one announced December
</I>&gt;<i> 2009. The release numbering then made me assume that that would be the
</I>&gt;<i> API for 3.0. Has this changed ?
</I>
The change announced in 2009 was to the underlying wire protocol.  That
was deployed in 2.91.
 
&gt;<i> Which release implements the API just announced ?
</I>
The upcoming 2.96 release.  The intent in is to ship 3.0 when we
believe both the JSON wire protocol and the C interface to the client
library are stable.  As you correctly note, we have slipped the
original schedule for this.

&gt;<i> Can you clarify which API works with which versions of gpsd ?
</I>
It's described in this portion of the gps.h header comment:

/*
 * 4.1 - Base version for initial JSON protocol (Dec 2009)
 * 4.2 - AIS application IDs split into DAC and FID (May 2010)
 * 5.0 - MAXCHANNELS bumped from 20 to 32 for GLONASS (July 2010)
 *       gps_open() becomes reentrant, what gps_open_r() used to be. 
 *       gps_poll() removed in favor of gps_read().  The raw hook is gone.
 */
#define GPSD_API_MAJOR_VERSION	5	/* bump on incompatible changes */
#define GPSD_API_MINOR_VERSION	0	/* bump on compatible changes */

The major number gets bumped when a change to the gps_data_t structure
breaks binary compatibility.

&gt;<i> (I'm interested in the C language API.) Basically I probably need the mapping
</I>&gt;<i> between three things :
</I>&gt;<i> - which API (e.g. how many parameters to gps_open)
</I>&gt;<i> - which version of the software to download (e.g. 2.95)
</I>&gt;<i> - which macros to use in #ifdef
</I>
Good question.  I've tried to be clear about this, but I'm too close
to the code.  I have changed that comment to read

/*
 * 4.1 - Base version for initial JSON protocol (Dec 2009, release 2.90)
 * 4.2 - AIS application IDs split into DAC and FID (July 2010, release 2.95)
 * 5.0 - MAXCHANNELS bumped from 20 to 32 for GLONASS (July 2010)
 *       gps_open() becomes reentrant, what gps_open_r() used to be. 
 *       gps_poll() removed in favor of gps_read().  The raw hook is gone.
 */

I hope this clarifies matters.  Use GPSD_API_MAJOR_VERSION to condition 
your gps_open() and gps_read()/gps_poll() calls.
 
&gt;<i> The dates in <A HREF="http://gpsd.berlios.de/protocol-transition.html">http://gpsd.berlios.de/protocol-transition.html</A> appear to
</I>&gt;<i> be outdated, also its example still has two, not three, parameters in
</I>&gt;<i> gps_open().
</I>
Checking...oops, that version is obsolete.  Yes, the schedule slipped; as
you can see in the NEWS file we've put an immense amount of work into
the last few releases. I've refreshed the version on the website.

&gt;<i> Finally, (developer.)berlios.de doesn't appear to work.
</I>
It's up now.  The site does tend to be flaky and I want to move us off of it.
