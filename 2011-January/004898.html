OOC, did you really get to the official NMEA Standard this way? I do not
mean to the place where you can buy the standard or become a member of
the NMEA group. The standard, as far as I know, is not publicly
available.

If you mean &quot;<A HREF="http://www.tronico.fi/OH6NT/docs/NMEA0183.pdf">http://www.tronico.fi/OH6NT/docs/NMEA0183.pdf</A>&quot;, well that
is not the standard. It is some guy's personal description of what he
thinks is the standard. It is always interesting to see what others have
found, but at the end of the day, all you have is an opinion. The
standard itself is not listed as a document in the References.

&gt;<i> &gt; We have not received competent legal advice indicating that we'd be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; allowed to write a compliant open-source parser after having seen the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; actual specification. We suspect that we'd get some kind of trouble,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; so we're not going to go there.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I don't understand the potential issue..?
</I>
I am not sure I do either. I am guessing it is just that it is usually
safer to not know something from certain sources, even if it may be
inconvenient. Could it be that the standard is available only under
terms of non-disclosure? So if you read it, you cannot make open source
code based on it. I do not know the answer to that. But I am guessing
that is the concern.


Yours sincerely,
Roger Oberholtzer
