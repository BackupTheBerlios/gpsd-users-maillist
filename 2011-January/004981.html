Ok, so if I turn the bluetooth device off I need to exit any apps using
gpsd. Then after I turn the device back on I can restart them, at least
one of them, and get reconnected.

I seem to be able to make this happen with the following scenario:

1. start things up and have xgps running and I am connected
2. Turn off the GPS device and in xgps see:

{&quot;class&quot;:&quot;DEVICE&quot;,&quot;path&quot;:&quot;/dev/rfcomm0&quot;,&quot;activated&quot;:0}

3. exit xgps
&lt; wait a little&gt;
4. Turn on the device
5. start xgps over again
6. It starts gathering data

That seems to play out. In fact I can keep the original xgps I started
in step 1 operating. I can skip step 3, let the xgps keep running, and
at step 5 start a second xgps. Then the device comes back on and I see
data in both xgps apps.

So, the rule is if I turn the bluetooth GPS device off when I turn it
back on I need to start up some app that uses it, to trigger an open and
reestablish a connection that will then be visible by all apps that may
have been left running as well as the new one started. Alternatively, I
can write my own script to remove it from the list and add it back after
it is turned back on and kick it in the head that way.

I suppose that typically if someone turns off the GPS they also exit the
apps. Seems you also have to remember to restart the GPS prior to
restarting the app or else you'll miss the open and gpsd won't
reconnect. In that case you'll have to exit the app and restart it when
the device is on to force a reconnect or start up another app that uses
the device through gpsd to force a reconnect.

Thanks
