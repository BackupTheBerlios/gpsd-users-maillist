<PRE>Hi list,

I'm new here, so bear with me please.

I am trying to use gpsfake (2.95) to 'playback' files containing NMEA
records collected from a GPS receiver. I am having some success. But
there are a few things I can't seem to sort out:

1. What are the minimum record types that gpsd needs to be able to
provide a fix? It seems to me that it is GGA and RMC. GGA alone is not
enough. Is this correct? The clients to gpsd that I am trying this with
are Navit and TangoGPS. Perhaps it is more a question of what they are
asking from gpsd?

2. I want to have the playback look somewhat realistic. With no options,
the locations are provided as fast as they are available. Which when
reading from a file means pretty quick. I have tried the -c option to
gpsfake. But I get unexpected results. I have a 10 Hz receiver, with 4
NMEA records per 'report'. That would mean 40 records per second. If I
specify -c 0.25, the reports seem to slow to a snail's pace. The
movement is in fact 50 km/h. I am guessing that I have misunderstood
something.

TIA for any help.

Yours sincerely,
Roger Oberholtzer
