</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> GGA should be sufficient by itself, but I don't think that mode of gpsd
</I>&gt;<i> operation is well tested.  I don't know of any devices that emit GGA but
</I>&gt;<i> not RMC.
</I>
All Trimble / Applanix / OxTS devices that we use are fully
configurable. You can get what you want. Some folk in these parts made a
decision that since we only need GGA for our own uses, that would be all
they keep. Seems like an innocent decision.

&gt;<i> You might find rerading driver_nmea.c instructive.
</I>
That file provided the clue. gpsd has an apparent limit to the length of
the GGA record. When I turn on debugging, I get this for the unhappy
files:

gpsd: &lt;= GPS: $GPGGA,094707.10,5055.89321076,N,00702.09807636,E,2,05,3.6,50.524,M,47.654,M,7.9,0100*75
gpsd: Overlong packet rejected.

As they only contain GGA and ZDA records, and all the GGA records are
rejected, there can be no fix.

In the files that work, the GGA record is:

$GPGGA,092700.10,5534.361945,N,01302.158638,E,2,08,1.0,21.17,M,40.77,M,2.9,0000*75

In the files that do not, the records are:

$GPGGA,094707.10,5055.89321076,N,00702.09807636,E,2,05,3.6,50.524,M,47.654,M,7.9,0100*75

Note that the decimal accuracy of the lat and long values is increased
by two. Other values also have an added decimal point.

There are some devices that have the increased resolution, but the
entire string length is still short enough to not cause a rejection:

$GPGGA,082559.00,3856.25368972,N,00621.76537476,W,1,9,0.9,260.000,M,50.995,M,,*47

The records are from Trimble Ag132, BD960 (and similar quality)
receivers and from Applanix Pos/LV devices. These devices can provide
centimeter accuracy. When they do... So the resolution of these values
has been increased by the manufacturer. In fact, all the high-end GPS
devices that we see these days have this increased resolution. Some
provide it even when the accuracy is not there. I suspect it is a
trend. 

&gt;<i> &gt; 2. I want to have the playback look somewhat realistic. With no options,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the locations are provided as fast as they are available. Which when
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; reading from a file means pretty quick. I have tried the -c option to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; gpsfake. But I get unexpected results. I have a 10 Hz receiver, with 4
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; NMEA records per 'report'. That would mean 40 records per second. If I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; specify -c 0.25, the reports seem to slow to a snail's pace. The
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; movement is in fact 50 km/h. I am guessing that I have misunderstood
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; something.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;From the manual page:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     The -c option sets the delay between sentences in
</I>&gt;<i>     seconds. Fractional values of seconds are legal.  The default is zero
</I>&gt;<i>     (no delay).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What part of this is difficult to understand?  If you're shipping 40
</I>&gt;<i> records per second, a delay of 0.25 will balloon a single second's output
</I>&gt;<i> to 10 seconds.  Of *course* it's slowed to a crawl; you'd need to drop 
</I>&gt;<i> the delay to 0.025 to approximate a 1-second-to-1-second mapping. 
</I>
Sorry, I mistyped the value in my post. In fact it was 0.025 that I
used. I do understand the concept. I must have mixed some files that had
a different report rate. I am doing a survey of data collected by
various measurement systems to see where each stand in terms of using
these tools. I will investigate further.
