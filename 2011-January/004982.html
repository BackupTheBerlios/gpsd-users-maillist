<PRE>Another GPSD release is coming up, with support for many new device types
and tasty features including the ability to report subframe data and noise
statistics. Also, the requirement for clients to define a gpsd_report() 
hook is gone.

Sadly, this release also brings with it an ABI and API compatibility
break in the C client library.  Yes, we know we've had too many binary
compatibility breaks in the past, and have been striving mightily to
avoid them over the last two years after one client maintainer
justifiably slapped us around about the problems they cause.  But
we've been defeated in our good intentions by GLONASS (the Russian
satnav system), support for which has required us to increase the
maximum allowed number of satellite channels.

Since the ABI had to change incompatibly, that opened a window.  We
have had a few improvements planned to the client API - things like
changing gps_open() to use a specified fix buffer rather than
returning an internally allocated one, making re-entrant code
possible.  Rather than spread these out over several releases, causing
pain each time, we're doing them all at once in hopes we can stay
forward-compatible without a break for the next few years.

Summary of changes:

gps_open() now takes three arguments instead of two, as previously noted.  

gps_poll() is renamed to gps_read().  The 'gps_poll()' name should be
considered reserved, as we may have plans for it relating to the new
semi-experimental ?POLL; command in the wire protocol.

gps_waiting() is now documented and officially available.

The set_raw_hook feature is gone.  Instead, code can just look at the 
response buffer after a read.

GPSD_API_MAJOR_VERSION has been bumped, so you will be able to
conditionalize your C code properly. As usual, cgps and gpxlogger
provide live usage examples and the entrty points are fully
documented.

At the wire-protocol level, timestamps in TPV and SKY objects are now
ISO 8601 timestamp strings rather than floats expressing seconds since
Unix epoch. The minor protocol version number in the VERSION response
has been bumped accordingly. 

?POLL; is a new facility for requesting a state dump from the daemon.
The response is a pile of hair that aggregates TPV and SKY
objects. Not yet supported in the C client API and, because of C static
typing and choices made to keep the client JSON parser small, may
never be.  It's intended for the use of client bindings in Python
and Perl and other dynamic languages.

I don't like the idea that the police department seems bent on keeping
a pool of unarmed victims available for the predations of the criminal
class.
