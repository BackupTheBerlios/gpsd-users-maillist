<PRE>[Resend after subscribing myself]

Hi Eric,

Thanks for the message. I have a few questions though.

I'm a bit confused about this change vs. the one announced December
2009. The release numbering then made me assume that that would be the
API for 3.0. Has this changed ?

Which release implements the API just announced ?

Can you clarify which API works with which versions of gpsd ? (I'm
interested in the C language API.) Basically I probably need the mapping
between three things :
- which API (e.g. how many parameters to gps_open)
- which version of the software to download (e.g. 2.95)
- which macros to use in #ifdef

The dates in <A HREF="http://gpsd.berlios.de/protocol-transition.html">http://gpsd.berlios.de/protocol-transition.html</A> appear to
be outdated, also its example still has two, not three, parameters in
gps_open().

Note that this is the very first link under the &quot;Urgent news&quot; heading on
the <A HREF="http://gpsd.berlios.de">http://gpsd.berlios.de</A> page.

Finally, (developer.)berlios.de doesn't appear to work.

</I>&gt;<i> maximum allowed number of satellite channels.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Since the ABI had to change incompatibly, that opened a window.  We
</I>&gt;<i> have had a few improvements planned to the client API - things like
</I>&gt;<i> changing gps_open() to use a specified fix buffer rather than

</I>&gt;<i> pain each time, we're doing them all at once in hopes we can stay
</I>&gt;<i> forward-compatible without a break for the next few years.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Summary of changes:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> gps_open() now takes three arguments instead of two, as previously noted.  
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> gps_poll() is renamed to gps_read().  The 'gps_poll()' name should be
</I>&gt;<i> considered reserved, as we may have plans for it relating to the new
</I>&gt;<i> semi-experimental ?POLL; command in the wire protocol.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> gps_waiting() is now documented and officially available.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The set_raw_hook feature is gone.  Instead, code can just look at the 
</I>&gt;<i> response buffer after a read.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> GPSD_API_MAJOR_VERSION has been bumped, so you will be able to
</I>&gt;<i> conditionalize your C code properly. As usual, cgps and gpxlogger
</I>&gt;<i> provide live usage examples and the entrty points are fully
</I>&gt;<i> documented.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> At the wire-protocol level, timestamps in TPV and SKY objects are now
</I>&gt;<i> ISO 8601 timestamp strings rather than floats expressing seconds since
</I>&gt;<i> Unix epoch. The minor protocol version number in the VERSION response
</I>&gt;<i> has been bumped accordingly. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ?POLL; is a new facility for requesting a state dump from the daemon.
</I>&gt;<i> The response is a pile of hair that aggregates TPV and SKY
</I>&gt;<i> objects. Not yet supported in the C client API and, because of C static
</I>&gt;<i> typing and choices made to keep the client JSON parser small, may
</I>&gt;<i> never be.  It's intended for the use of client bindings in Python
</I>&gt;<i> and Perl and other dynamic languages.
