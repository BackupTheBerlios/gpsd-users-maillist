&gt;<i> Charles, thanks for the response.

</I>&gt;<i> In trying to figure out how to make the FireFox geolocation using

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So what do I do now? I can make the FF code look for GND, MID2 and
</I>&gt;<i> RMC (although I haven't ever seen an RMC AFAIK), But where does it
</I>&gt;<i> end? How many OTHER tag o=XXX will I have to discover in order to be
</I>&gt;<i> assured of seeing all?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That's why I was hoping I'd get some sort of mapping that is
</I>&gt;<i> performed between the gps input to gpsd and the gpsd output to my
</I>&gt;<i> client.
</I>
As others have already mentioned, those are SiRF only sentences. For
the more general case, I would go with another solution.

Here is what I would do to provide the most general solution right
now for almost any general purpose client, i.e. where you don't know
which version of gpsd you have:

* Check to see if we are running on Windows. If so, tell the user to
  get a real operating system and give up. As far as I know, gpsd does
  not run on Windows and the maintainers have no plans to change that.

* Check for a recent libgps. libgps19 is the current version. Once gpsd
  3.0 is released, I'd look for that version. If I find it, use it and
  turn on JSON. This mean a bit of C library loader hacking.

* Failing that, try to connect using telnet (which the user should be
  able to configure). Use NMEA. If telnet fails, warn the user, and
  then give up.

* Check the version of the protocol, and act accordingly.

The NMEA situation is a mess, and gpsd &lt; 2.90 does a lot to clean it up
and present a consistent NMEA dialect to the client. The JSON protocol
is even better, and it is the one being maintained.

There is a bug in the Mozilla issue tracker on this. Last I looked,
no-one had taken it up. If you are hacking the Firefox code, please
consider taking it on so that Firefox works with gpsd HEAD and 3.0 when
it comes out.

When you are comfortable that almost all of your users are using gpsd
3.0+, the telnet/NMEA branch should go away. That may be a while.
