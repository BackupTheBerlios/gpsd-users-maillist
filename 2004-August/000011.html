<PRE>My problem with the earlier versions was fixed in 1.94.  Turns out that
that multi-gpsd-watcher patch could also cause problems if a single
sender sent anything very quickly to gpsd.  I spent a lot of time
debugging and came up with the same patch, when I went to mail it to
this list I saw the update and retested with 1.94 and it worked fine.

I then made the patches to qpegps to use 1.95.  I've submitted those to
the authur for review.  I did notice one slight problem, but it could be
my gps.

When the return values of 'Y' are sent I've seen duplicate satellite
names returned in a single Y response.  I first noticed it graphically
and confirmed that I got the same result in a telnet session.

On another note, the only functionality lost in converting qpegps was
that you don't support the Heading or Bearing commands.  Bearing was a
garmin specific options so I can see that not being high on the priority
list, but Heading does make sense.

The argument I would use for including Heading is most gps apps could
use that feature.  I would suggest it return '?' if the current V value
was not above something reasonable (qpegps used &gt;0.2m/s).  When
traveling I could see it interesting to store the values from DPAVH at
some polling interval.

Thanks for the great work you've done.

I intend on sending my OpenEmbedded build recipe to the OE team shortly.
