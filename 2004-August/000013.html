<PRE>&gt;<i> On another note, the only functionality lost in converting qpegps was
</I>&gt;<i> that you don't support the Heading or Bearing commands.  Bearing was a
</I>&gt;<i> garmin specific options so I can see that not being high on the
</I>&gt;<i> priority list, but Heading does make sense.
</I>
It is in 1.95:

&quot;T&quot;
heading = track = course over ground = course made good

I think of bearing as 'bearing to waypoint' which is given by GPBOD.



&gt;<i> The argument I would use for including Heading is most gps apps could
</I>&gt;<i> use that feature.  I would suggest it return '?' if the current V
</I>&gt;<i> value was not above something reasonable (qpegps used &gt;0.2m/s).  When
</I>&gt;<i> traveling I could see it interesting to store the values from DPAVH at
</I>&gt;<i> some polling interval.
</I>
Please no, just report what the GPS says. In my navigation software the
trend arrow's direction is controlled by the heading and the size of the
arrow is controlled by speed. When you are stopped the arrow shrinks to
nothing.

[It is scaled so that the arrow points to where you are expected to be
in 20 minutes time. From there it is easy to eyeball from the arrow
where you will be in 5min or an hour too. I considered adding a
smoothing filter into the heading but in practice it worked remarkably
well &amp; didn't need one.]



One useful proprietary Garmin message that might be worth mentioning is
PGRME for error estimation.

from nmeafaq.txt:
    $PGRME,15.0,M,45.0,M,25.0,M*22
       15.0,M       Estimated horizontal position error in metres (HPE)
       45.0,M       Estimated vertical error (VPE) in metres
       25.0,M       Overall spherical equivalent position error


e.g. for drawing confidence circles around your position
