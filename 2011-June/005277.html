<PRE>In the light of the recent discussion on these lists regarding possible 
improvements to the current state of the startup and hotplug system used 
by gpsd currently, I would like to make a new suggestions based on the 
the points raised by those who contributed to the discussion:

1. Create a gpsdctl (not gpsctl) program which acts as a client passing 
commands to the gpsd daemon for the purpose of controlling the daemon 
itself, not the gps device (which is done by the gpsctl, if I understand 
correctly).
2. This would take over most of the stuff done currently by gpsd.hotplug 
and gpsd.hotplug.wrapper, namely:
   a. Perform various basic checks, such as gpsd binary executable, /var 
being read-write for creation of socket etc.
   b. Check if a gpsd daemon is already running, and if not, start one 
with basic options from /etc/gpsd.conf if found (bare with me on this one).
   c. Ask gpsd to add a new device to its pool - through the socket and 
pass any other commands through the socket, without the need for a 
script and socket programming.

This could be made to work (with minimal changes) for both embedded 
environments and non-embedded ones:

1. If /etc/gpsd.conf is not found, gpsd starts with assumed defaults, 
just like now.
2. If /etc/gpsd.conf is found, load basic settings from there.
3. Gpsdctl would either use the socket path found in /etc/gpsd.conf, or 
receive the socket path to use to talk to gpsd on the command line &quot;-F 
/var/gpsd.sock&quot;. The second option would mean it can work without using 
gpsd.conf, and would also allow the option of having several different 
gpsd instances, using different ports, and different sockets to be 
communicated with.

Advantages of the above setup:

1. Would require minimal modification - all gpsd behaviour and options 
would stay the same as currently - it would just load the equivalent of 
it's current command line options from /etc/gpsd.conf if it finds it, 
otherwise behave just as it does now.
2. /etc/gpsd.conf would not be such a major change, as /etc/default/gpsd 
is already being used by /lib/udev/gpsd.hotplug.wrapper anyway and it 
contains the same options.
3. gpsdctl could be a proper binary, part of the distribution, located 
in /usr/bin, with the other gpsd related binaries.
4. The udev rule could be simplified to something like 
&quot;RUN+=/usr/bin/gpsdctl --add-device /dev/ttyUSB%n&quot; or similar.
5. Would provide a great deal of flexibility for very little extra 
complexity - with straight forward configurations possible for 
hotplugging using udev, running several gpsd daemons on different ports 
(and different sockets), and running without any configuration files.


This would do away with the two hotplug scripts, while hiding all the 
socket communication in a nice binary, properly named and located with 
the rest of the project - but without being included in gpsd or 
affecting the gpsd code.

In order to keep everything wrapped up neat - it would be probably good 
(but not absolutely necessary) to end up starting and stopping and 
controlling gpsd exclusively through gpsdctl. For example, if gpsdctl is 
called without socket option and there is no gpsd.conf to specify a 
socket option - then it will start gpsd without socket communication - 
and will have no way to pass further commands to it. But it means all 
command line syntax will refer to gpsdctl - instead of part of it 
referencing gpsd and part of it gpsdctl. Gpsdctl will become effectively 
a unified command line interface to gpsd (but able to start the daemon 
if it's not running, do checks and be able to talk to several daemon 
instances - all of which gpsd currently can't - and shouldn't be able to 
anyway).

Is this any closer to the spirit of the gpsd project and the desired goals?


Sebastian
