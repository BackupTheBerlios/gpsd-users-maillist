Separating my pleading request from practical arguments:

Scripting is great for sure.  But. There is already a bunch of C code
creating a socket server that listens and accepts various commands over
that socket. Granted scripting is simple, but I'm not entirely clear why
it's a stretch and that we need a scripting language to make a very
simple client, that historically has changed very slowly, to talk to the
server side?  By definition the skills and code to read/write to the
socket must already be available and likely the little client app could
be written using only cut-n-paste?

I do agree that scripting is nice, it's just that the requirements here
seem so trivial and for certain classes of use there is such a huge
&quot;cost&quot; to include the scripting language, that I don't really understand
why it even feels useful to oppose such a change? (Note I do get the
&quot;doesn't both me, submit a patch if you want it&quot;, but your answer comes
over as &quot;I feel that this bit is actually better written in python than C&quot;?)

Note also that Bash can read/write to various sockets.  However, I also
don't have bash in my cut down distro...

Basically busybox + uclibc (or some other small libc) gives you an
incredibly functional environment in just a MB or so of diskspace.
Adding gpsd adds only a few 10s KB to the install size.  Starting from
that position (less than the size of a floppy disk) do you see why it's
attractive for certain projects to try and minimise dependencies if they
can?

I will be writing my own udev wrapper to replace the current python
code.  I would have no issue with contributing any of that back again,
although my wrapper will need to solve slightly different problems in
that I need to probe for real modems and treat those differently to gps
devices.

Grateful if you would give serious consideration to keeping the core
parts of gpsd without python dependencies (obviously knock yourself out
where it makes sense for non core parts...!)

Thanks

Ed W
