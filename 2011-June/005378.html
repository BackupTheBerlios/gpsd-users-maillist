<PRE>Ed W &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-users">lists at wildgooses.com</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> I think we are talking past each other again?
</I>
We must be, because every time I think I understand what you want and why
you want it you say something that confuses me again.  

And please stop using '?' as an end of sentence when it's not a
question.  This is like an annoying verbal tic that makes it more 
difficult to pay attention to what you are trying to say.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We are digressing, but are we in dispute that for *any* linux package,
</I>&gt;<i> the number of users who run the equivalent of &quot;make install&quot; is near
</I>&gt;<i> zero, compared with the number of users who do &quot;yum/dpkg my_package&quot;?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I would presume not?
</I>
Correct.  But this ratio is completely irrelevant to the request I understand
you to be making.

&gt;<i> I would claim that just because few people use something, is not always
</I>&gt;<i> a good reason for rendering it unimportant?  One person in the whole
</I>&gt;<i> world might use &quot;python=no&quot;, but the result of running that might be a
</I>&gt;<i> binary package for every android phone in the world?  The number of
</I>&gt;<i> users can be large compared with the number using the source package?
</I>
Irrelevant.  The relevant number is the amount of effort and time the
option would save per packaging operation, not the numbers of users
on the other end.
 
&gt;<i> Now, for sure I will eventually develop a series of patches to your
</I>&gt;<i> build system that hack it support my choices, but since it appears like
</I>&gt;<i> a trivial upstream inclusion, it would be great if that time could be
</I>&gt;<i> spent programming other stuff?
</I>
You have yet to persuade me that python=no would do anything useful.
 
&gt;<i> I think you are missing the point that binary packages are built on a
</I>&gt;<i> different system to where they are installed (as a general rule)?
</I>&gt;<i> Therefore step 3 above is not needed.  You do:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1) scons install
</I>&gt;<i> 2) Build package (python=no)
</I>&gt;<i> 3) Distribute package to hundreds of other machines
</I>&gt;<i> 4) Install package on hundreds of other machines
</I>
I get it. If you don't have Python, you're fucked at step 2; you can't build 
the package without Python. If you do have Python, installing the Python
support isn't a problem.  So I don't see how python=no is helpful.
 
&gt;<i> The goal is to avoid as much as possible of step 2.5: Fixup built
</I>&gt;<i> package to manually exclude redundant extra stuff
</I>
That goal doesn't interest me, because I don't believe you can eliminate
that step in the general case and I'm not interested in complicating my
build system to do a half-assed job of it. 
 
&gt;<i> &gt; I ask again:  Where is the not-good experience in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    scons install
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    &lt;build package&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    scons uninstall
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; You've got Python on your build machine, by hypothesis, so what is so terrible
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; about installing the Python support and uninstalling it after your package 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; build?  Has it got cooties or something?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I don't need to uninstall it from the build machine?
</I>
I don't care.  I'm not going to create python=no to save you typing a
command you'd really have to do as cleanup anyway.

&gt;<i> My build script at present looks something like:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 	./configure --prefix=/tmp/my_package
</I>&gt;<i> 	make install
</I>&gt;<i> 	rm /tmp/my_package/usr/lib/python2.{6,7}
</I>&gt;<i> 	rm /tmp/my_package/usr/bin/*.py
</I>&gt;<i> 	package_it /tmp/my_package
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Please help me remove the &quot;rm&quot; steps in the middle?
</I>
I'm not persuaded.  First, you're going to have to rewrite that anyway
because we're not using autotools anymore.  Second, since you have to have
a build script, I prefer you writing remove commands in it to adding an
scons configuration option that just begs to be set wrong.
