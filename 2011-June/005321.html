I have three different devices from different manufacturers with the 
SirfStar III chipset - and all of them present these symptoms. I've just 
had a Globalsat ND100S plugged in for 32 minutes. Gpsmon shows it can 
see 4 satellites - but it never got to the point of obtaining a fix or 
seeing more satellites. I have then plugged the BueNext BN-903S in - and 
within 2 minutes it obtained a fix and could see 7 satellites. Neither 
of the two was used within the last 24 hours. All the experiment taking 
place in the same spot in my house - no movement or change of 
conditions. Within 40 minutes - thus the weather, atmospheric and 
electro-magnetic propagation conditions being roughly the same.

Saying that SirfStar III doesn't have the problems or that it is a high 
quality chip is one thing. What I see in practice, however, looks very 
different. Unless anybody can explain the significant gap in performance 
any other way.

I must be the only one noticing these differences or willing to notice them.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> information about different GPS chips and adapters available (not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> necessarily only USB) where people could add their ratings/experiences with

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> firmwares available and any other useful information. This could also be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> used by people when choosing receivers to purchase.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Good idea. Please do it.
