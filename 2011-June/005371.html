Aha, I start to understand why we are talking past each other.  Please
re-read your sentence above and I think you can see why I'm
misunderstanding you?  I (incorrectly) read what you wrote as &quot;you can't
run scons on the source machine if the target machine doesn't have python&quot;

Apologies, but I think you can also see why I'm misunderstanding you? (I
am British..)


&gt;<i> If all you want is a python=no option that disables Python
</I>&gt;<i> installation on the *source* machine, I could do that. But if I do,
</I>&gt;<i> occasionally people who want the full install are going to
</I>&gt;<i> accidentally set it wrong, and I'm doubtful the very minor convenience

</I>
I think your implicit assumption is that there are only (4) binary
packagers in the whole world and everyone else is using their packages?
 If that were so then arguably we wouldn't even need a &quot;make install&quot;
script..?!

I think the point is that there are lots of folks who occasionally
install from source and aren't experts on the packages in question.  I
run a lot of packages from source and the ones where I need spend no
more than two mins reading the &quot;./configure --help&quot; output are by far
the most satisfying to work with.  I get that you aren't using
autotools, but I hope you will have it as a goal to give casual source
users a good experience where possible?

Why not make &quot;python=yes&quot; the default and then it should be really hard
for some binary packager to get this wrong? The point of &quot;python=no&quot; is
to facilitate less common uses.  I do think gpsd is one of those small
number of great packages which will be integrated into a very wide
variety of purposes in the long term (it's bordering on being a core
infrastructure component for some classes of use) - please try and keep
the flexibility that we can bend it to these uses without having to
fight the build system?


&gt;&gt;<i> P.S.  How close are we to a release now?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm waiting on some work from ckuethe and gemiller.

Cool - looking forward to it!

Cheers
