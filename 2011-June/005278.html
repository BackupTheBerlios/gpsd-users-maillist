<PRE>Sebastian Arcus &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-users">shop at open-t.co.uk</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> Why not modify gpsctl so that &quot;gpsctl add /dev/foo&quot; can start gpsd
</I>&gt;<i> if it is not already started.
</I>
Because you can already do exactly this with gpsd.hotplug, and I fail
to see how duplicating that functionality (and tangling C code up
with the details of things like the control-socket location) would
improve matters.

&gt;<i> Well, on Linux the line between &quot;end users&quot; and &quot;system
</I>&gt;<i> administrators&quot; and &quot;software packagers&quot; is never a clear cut one.
</I>
It is very clear-cut here.  End-users are people who plug a
USB GPS into a port and expect it to work without having to configure
anytthing.  Software packagers are the people whose job it is to
mate the distributed GPSD source to a distro so that the end-users
have a seamless it-just-works experience

I am optimizing for end-users, and I'm not interested in a pointless 
definitional wrangle about the boundaries of that category.

&gt;<i> That is the whole point of open source, with people being encouraged
</I>&gt;<i> to setup and maintain their own systems. So, sooner or later, the
</I>&gt;<i> end users of gpsd come into equation by having to deal with the
</I>&gt;<i> issue of configuring the gpsd hotplug/startup one way or another.
</I>
No, they don't.  Your premise is incorrect, because you have confused
&quot;end users&quot; with &quot;inveterate tinkerers who run Slackware&quot;. All that
follows from your premise is therefore merely noise.

&gt;<i> So please, stop using the expression &quot;zero-configuration&quot;.
</I>
When a gpsd binary package is built correctly on a hotplug-supporting
system, it is indeed zero-configuration for most GPSes, so I will
continue to use that expression and mean it.  And even if gpsd had not
achieved zero-configuration on many production systems, that would
be a worthy goal that explains why we don't do things like proliferating
configuration files and switches.

&gt;<i> &gt;If you explain how they're failing, perhaps they can be fixed.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I've spent most of the weekend trying to get gpsd working properly
</I>&gt;<i> on Slackware. In Slackware, the first pass of udev during boot is
</I>&gt;<i> done while the file system is read-only. I've implemented your
</I>&gt;<i> scripts and the udev rule - but gpsd can't start because it needs RW
</I>&gt;<i> access to create /var/run/gpsd.sock.
</I>
If that was your problem, why didn't you just say so instead of going
on a rant about the architecture?  You're not an end-user, you're
a hacker who's trying to do something unusual. That's OK, but all this 
talk of end-users and everyone having to configure eventually is a
distraction from the actual issue.

&gt;<i> I'm sorry, but all those evil pieces of software you talked about
</I>&gt;<i> earlier which use config files manage on only one or two config
</I>&gt;<i> files. Somehow, you've managed to keep the mess out of your code and
</I>&gt;<i> dump it all over the place elsewhere.
</I>
Yes, and you've just demonstrated exactly why that was the right thing
to do.  Because fixing the startup scripts to cope with that will be
easier than if we'd had to modify C to do it.  

&gt;<i> I agree with software being able to do one thing, and do it well.
</I>&gt;<i> But in that case provide a simpler interface, so that udev can
</I>&gt;<i> notify gpsd or gpsctl directly of new devices - without using a
</I>&gt;<i> chain of scripts and configs ridiculously long. And maybe include
</I>&gt;<i> some of that mess inside gpsd - for the sake of providing a simpler
</I>&gt;<i> and cleaner interface to the world.
</I>
Including that mess inside gpsd absolutely will not happen, for reasons
I and others have explained.  If you want to work with us on simplifying
and improving the hotplug scripts, that we'll do.

&gt;<i>                           It's called compromise and it's
</I>&gt;<i> called making your software useful and simpler for users - not only
</I>&gt;<i> clean and pure inside for the programmers working on it.
</I>
What you are doing is called &quot;being pointlessly annoying&quot;, and you
should stop.  Pretending that your complaints have anything to do with
the end-user experience is a species of bullshit up with which I will
not put.  Just so we understand each other.
