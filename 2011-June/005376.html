I think we are talking past each other again?

We are digressing, but are we in dispute that for *any* linux package,
the number of users who run the equivalent of &quot;make install&quot; is near
zero, compared with the number of users who do &quot;yum/dpkg my_package&quot;?

I would presume not?

I would claim that just because few people use something, is not always
a good reason for rendering it unimportant?  One person in the whole
world might use &quot;python=no&quot;, but the result of running that might be a
binary package for every android phone in the world?  The number of
users can be large compared with the number using the source package?

(FWIW: I have zero expectation of ANY user of my distribution EVER
compiling the sources themselves... They will all use the binaries... I
would be impressed if any even knew what source code was...)

Now, for sure I will eventually develop a series of patches to your
build system that hack it support my choices, but since it appears like
a trivial upstream inclusion, it would be great if that time could be
spent programming other stuff?

</I>
Ok... So do this on your Netgear router right now..?

I think you are missing the point that binary packages are built on a
different system to where they are installed (as a general rule)?
Therefore step 3 above is not needed.  You do:

1) scons install
2) Build package (python=no)
3) Distribute package to hundreds of other machines
4) Install package on hundreds of other machines

The goal is to avoid as much as possible of step 2.5: Fixup built
package to manually exclude redundant extra stuff

For sure there always ends up being a step 2.5 (deliberate silly name),
just have a look at Debian/Redhat source packages, but I think the goal
of opensource is to develop everything in upstream, not closed off.  If
I implement python=no for my own purposes then it's one more thing I
need to maintain and I claim that there exist other users of small
systems who will need to also do the same work again?


&gt;&gt;<i>  If that were so then arguably we wouldn't even need a &quot;make install&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> script..?!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Don't be silly.  'make install' is required for people who *aren't* packagers.
</I>
Very few people run &quot;make install&quot; versus using the output of a packager
though...

However, I don't think this makes it fair to give the package maintainer
a bunch of work though - they have plenty of other packages to maintain
(seems to be the biggest barrier for all distributions - cost of
developing and maintaining packaging tools)



&gt;<i> I ask again:  Where is the not-good experience in
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    scons install
</I>&gt;<i>    &lt;build package&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>    scons uninstall
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You've got Python on your build machine, by hypothesis, so what is so terrible
</I>&gt;<i> about installing the Python support and uninstalling it after your package 
</I>&gt;<i> build?  Has it got cooties or something?
</I>
I don't need to uninstall it from the build machine?

The build machine is big and beefy and has python/scons, etc permanently
installed.  The build machine generates a binary package (which
currently includes a bunch of .py files) that is then installed on the
target machine.  The target machine has no python interpretor so the
extra .py files are just taking up space

We seem to be talking cross purposes, so I don't know scons, but in
autotools kind of thinking you might implement a crude packager
something like:

	./configure --prefix=/tmp/my_package --disable-python
	make install
	tar -f my_package-0.1.tar.gz /tmp/my_package

Then you take your output from step 3 (which for sure is likely
something better than a tar file, but that's not important), and apply
it to your various target

Note step 2 could be:
	make use-python-to-install

It's a given that python is available during the build process, what I
desire is a way to filter the output of make install to exclude any .py
files

My build script at present looks something like:

	./configure --prefix=/tmp/my_package
	make install
	rm /tmp/my_package/usr/lib/python2.{6,7}
	rm /tmp/my_package/usr/bin/*.py
	package_it /tmp/my_package

Please help me remove the &quot;rm&quot; steps in the middle?

Thanks

Ed W
