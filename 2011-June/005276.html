</I>
Why not modify gpsctl so that &quot;gpsctl add /dev/foo&quot; can start gpsd if it 
is not already started. That would get rid of at least one script file. 
One thing I learned about IT systems (and any other systems) is that the 
potential for fowl up rises with any extra component. You promote the 
idea that config files are &quot;evil&quot; and complicate things - but you 
certainly have no qualms with 5 different scripts and programs (udevd -&gt; 
gpsd.hotplug.wrapper -&gt; gpsd.hotplug -&gt; gpsctl -&gt; /var/run/gpsd.sock -&gt; 
gpsd) handling a single task. It certainly points to a rather narrow 
approach.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     What you are basically doing is keeping gpsd
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> pure from a programming point of view, with as little options as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> possible - while dumping the mess of controlling it and starting it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to system packagers and end users by providing an inappropriate
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> interface.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That's all correct, except for the conjuct &quot;end users&quot; annd the
</I>&gt;<i> adjective &quot;inappropriate&quot;. End users never see this; that's the point
</I>&gt;<i> of zero configuration.
</I>
Well, on Linux the line between &quot;end users&quot; and &quot;system administrators&quot; 
and &quot;software packagers&quot; is never a clear cut one. That is the whole 
point of open source, with people being encouraged to setup and maintain 
their own systems. So, sooner or later, the end users of gpsd come into 
equation by having to deal with the issue of configuring the gpsd 
hotplug/startup one way or another.

And by the way - your concept of zero-configuration is a rather limited 
one. Gpsd does an excellent job of identifying and configuring gps 
devices *once* it is being fed the actual device name. But the job of 
actually getting that device name to gpsd is a major pain in the a$%$&#163; - 
as that part of the interface is completely unhelpful. This is 
demonstrated by the need of one bash script and one Python script simply 
for udev to tell gpsd that a new device has been plugged in.

So please, stop using the expression &quot;zero-configuration&quot;. What you 
really mean is &quot;zero-configuration once gpsd knows exactly which device 
it needs to look at&quot;. Unless my gps device is on /dev/ttyUSB0 *and* it 
is plugged in before gpsd is started - gpsd is helpless without all 
sorts of extra scripts. That is not zero-configuration. Zero 
configuration would be for me to be able to just type &quot;gpsd&quot; at the 
command line - and the rest to happen magically, regardless of which 
device name my gps dongle is using - be it that I have already a gps 
device plugged in, or plug it later.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Controlling gpsd and starting gpsd *is* a mess; that's unavoidable due
</I>&gt;<i> to platform issues.  When you can code a mess like that in Python or
</I>&gt;<i> shell rather than C, it's an excellent idea to do so and *not* to have
</I>&gt;<i> that mess commingled with your core code.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Well, so instead of having &quot;evil&quot; config files, you prefer to have a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> chain of 4 other pieces of software doing what one single, well
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> designed one could have done. Seems to me like taking a pretty
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> narrow view of hight quality programming.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you think a single, well-designed script can replace all four of
</I>&gt;<i> those files, I think you have no idea how udev actually works.  But
</I>&gt;<i> I would be happy if you proved me wrong by writing that script and
</I>&gt;<i> submitting it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Fine - in that case find a way so that the hotplug system can pass a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> single, simple command line to gpsd when a new device is plugged in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - instead of requiring two different scripts which don't even work
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> properly on all distributions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you explain how they're failing, perhaps they can be fixed.
</I>
I've spent most of the weekend trying to get gpsd working properly on 
Slackware. In Slackware, the first pass of udev during boot is done 
while the file system is read-only. I've implemented your scripts and 
the udev rule - but gpsd can't start because it needs RW access to 
create /var/run/gpsd.sock. I've tried modifying gpsd.hotplug.wrapper to 
fail if the file system in read-only - so that udev can re-run it on the 
second pass - to no avail. I ended up having to write another rc.gpsd 
startup script - which starts gpsd later after the fs is mounted 
read-write - but also had to keep the udev rule and the two hotplug 
scripts - to cope with the case of inserting my gps device after the 
system is booted. All in all, to have things running on Slackware you need:

/etc/udev/rules.d/gpsd.rules
/etc/default/gpsd
/lib/udev/gpsd.hotplug.wrapper
/lib/udev/gpsd.hotplug
/etc/rc.d/rc.gpsd


That's five different config and script files just to start gpsd. I'm 
sorry, but all those evil pieces of software you talked about earlier 
which use config files manage on only one or two config files. Somehow, 
you've managed to keep the mess out of your code and dump it all over 
the place elsewhere.

I agree with software being able to do one thing, and do it well. But in 
that case provide a simpler interface, so that udev can notify gpsd or 
gpsctl directly of new devices - without using a chain of scripts and 
configs ridiculously long. And maybe include some of that mess inside 
gpsd - for the sake of providing a simpler and cleaner interface to the 
world. It's called compromise and it's called making your software 
useful and simpler for users - not only clean and pure inside for the 
programmers working on it.
