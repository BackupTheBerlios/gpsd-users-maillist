<PRE>I have three usb gps receivers based on Sirf Star III:

1. Globalsat ND-100S
2. Globalsat BU-353
3. Navilock NL-302U

All of them also use the PL2303 serial-to-usb chip. All of them are 
recent designs - still in production, still available to buy.

These three adapters above are always really slow to obtain a fix. If 
they haven't been used for 24 hours - they will take about 10 minutes. 
If they haven't been used for few days, it's more like 15-20 minutes. 
Worse on cloudy days.

I also have the following usb adapters:

1. BlueNext BN-903S - based on the Adopt SkyTraq Venus 6 chipset and the 
Cygnal CP210x serial-to-usb chip.
2. Globalsat ND-100 - based on unknown chipset - but most likely not the 
SirfStar III - as it lists 48 channels as opposed to 20 channels listed 
for all SirfStar III adapters I've seen.

The two adapters above are a lot faster. Normally within one minute they 
will have a fix (few seconds for a hot plug) - on worse or cloudy days, 
and if I have obstructions arounds me - maybe 2-3 minutes. The funny 
thing is that, the BlueNext adapter is about half of the price of most 
SirfStar III based adapters I have seen.

My question is: is SirfStar III a lower quality chip? Could someone in 
the know throw some light on this please. It seems to be referred to in 
really high terms on various websites - but my experience seems to point 
to it being lower quality then other chipsets used in usb receivers. 
Even the fact that it only has 20 channels, and uses 4800bps (both lower 
then other chipsets) appears to suggest lower capabilities.

Also, it would be nice if there would be a place to collate all this 
information about different GPS chips and adapters available (not 
necessarily only USB) where people could add their ratings/experiences 
with different models, any tricks, bugs discovered, information about 
new firmwares available and any other useful information. This could 
also be used by people when choosing receivers to purchase.
