<PRE>Ed W &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-users">lists at wildgooses.com</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> I think your implicit assumption is that there are only (4) binary
</I>&gt;<i> packagers in the whole world and everyone else is using their packages?
</I>
Mostly, yes. For a python=no switch to have a lot of utility, there
have to be a lot of people who are (a) installing from source, (b)
therefore have Python on their source machines, but (b) for some
reason don't want to install the Python support.  

Sorry, I just don't believe that's a large set.  And you haven't
helped your case any by talking about target machines as though you're
cross-compiling; thatt's a completely different set of issues.  

Yes, I get that you want to binary-package for systems without Python,
but python=no would be just no help at all with that.  In what unverse is
it difficult to do

   scons install
   &lt;build package&gt;
   scons uninstall

?

&gt;<i>  If that were so then arguably we wouldn't even need a &quot;make install&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> script..?!
</I>
Don't be silly.  'make install' is required for people who *aren't* packagers.
 
&gt;<i> I think the point is that there are lots of folks who occasionally
</I>&gt;<i> install from source and aren't experts on the packages in question.  I
</I>&gt;<i> run a lot of packages from source and the ones where I need spend no
</I>&gt;<i> more than two mins reading the &quot;./configure --help&quot; output are by far
</I>&gt;<i> the most satisfying to work with.  I get that you aren't using
</I>&gt;<i> autotools, but I hope you will have it as a goal to give casual source
</I>&gt;<i> users a good experience where possible?
</I>
I ask again:  Where is the not-good experience in

   scons install
   &lt;build package&gt;
   scons uninstall

You've got Python on your build machine, by hypothesis, so what is so terrible
about installing the Python support and uninstalling it after your package 
build?  Has it got cooties or something?
