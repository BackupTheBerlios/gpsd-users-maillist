Super proposal.

Just my 2p, but I'm trying to build a very compact distribution for my
needs.  At the moment I have zero need for python on that distribution,
*other* than if gpsd pulls it in.

Now a quick scan of my chroot compile environment shows python2.6
consuming approx 36MB of disk (excluding headers, ie just lib).  Note
this may be slightly high because it includes some dependent modules
which can perhaps be stripped. However, my main distribution is
currently around 10MB after squashfs, so adding Python will
substantially add to the install size...

I don't know if dd-wrt, tomato or any of these other popular router
distros currently ship python, but just a quick estimate it seems like a
lot of storage to give up if they don't otherwise have a use for python?

Note, I wholeheartedly agree that scripting languages are great for
development.  I have large applications written entirely in perl for
exactly that reason.  I would go so far to say that I see no obvious
reason that the entirety of gpsd couldn't be written entirely in python?

However, gpsd is a potentially useful piece of software for all kinds of
purposes from mobile phones, small routers and other mobile devices - as
a class these devices tend to be storage and processor constrained and
it's a definite benefit to minimise dependencies where possible...  As
such I would personally be extremely grateful if you would make python a
completely optional piece of gpsd at runtime (compile time dependency is
completely fine).  ...Actually it would be great if the ./configure
script would re-acquire it's --disable-python option to avoid shipping
any python deps..?

Thanks for your consideration..

Ed W
