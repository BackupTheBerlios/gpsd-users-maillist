The closest thing we have right now to AGPS is NTRIP relay.

AGPS would require:
a) a source of initialization data
b) a physical way to get them into the receiver
c) documentation on how to do these.
d) other stuff

I don't know of any freely available sources of initialization data -
ok that's not exactly true. you could dump your receiver's state,
cold-start, reload the state and get something like a &quot;hot start&quot;.
there are commercial services offering extended lifetime ephemerides,
but they're commercial and probably unavailable to a random end-user

depending on the receiver design intialization may need to be loaded
through an auxiliary port. at least ublox and sirf receivers have a
protocol message you can send to load a big blob of assistance data
over the primary serial port.

documentation is sketchy. AGPS seems to be one of those proprietary
value-added features, which means we're probably not going to find out
what magic is required.

there are several kinds of AGPS. in the simplest case, the assistance
mechanism just pushes enough data at the receiver to do a warm/hot
start. more complicated arrangments allow for the receiver to push raw
measurements to a more powerful machine which will calculate the
receivers' position and then send the position back.

i see some value in being able to load a dump of receiver state, but
it won't be receiver independent. I'm not ruling it out, but i don't
see a good way to do it yet.

GDB has a 'break' feature; why doesn't it have 'fix' too?
