<PRE>Philip,
Have you checked that module pl2303 is loaded (I assume you need it)?
Have you checked the output from gpsd for hints? The command might vary 
depending on distro but is something like
#killall gpsd
#gpsd -ND4 /dev/ttyUSB0
or perhaps
#gpsd -ND4 /dev/tty/USB0
Regards
Claus

</I>&gt;<i> satelitte info come from the gps unit?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I got gpsd and the clients from the links to the Debian packages on
</I>&gt;<i> the gpsd web site. They installed with no errors. I believe the
</I>&gt;<i> version of gpsd is 2.33.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My laptop is a Dell Latitude C400, 1.2G PIII, 512M RAM. I assume
</I>&gt;<i> that's enough computer to run this, since it's the only thing I have

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The GPS is a Garmin GPSMAP 60Cx which has both USB and a serial
</I>&gt;<i> interface. I also tested with a Garmin GPS V and a GPS III+ which have
</I>&gt;<i> only serial interfaces.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> All of these worked the same with the serial interface. Using the xgps
</I>&gt;<i> tool, I could see accurate data that matched the gps display. No
</I>&gt;<i> amount of fiddling with the -s option would make the display 'stable'.
</I>&gt;<i> The clock updated in 2 second intervals, and the data lock alternately
</I>&gt;<i>  showed a fix and then no data. Setting -s from 0 to 10 had no effect.
</I>&gt;<i> I wasn't moving, so the velocity data was always n/a.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> These three gps units have setup screens that allow configuration of
</I>&gt;<i> the com ports. In order to get anything, I have to set them to NMEA
</I>&gt;<i> in/out. The default GARMIN mode gets me nothing. On the 60Cx, with the
</I>&gt;<i> USB cable connected, the com port settings are ignored. At least that
</I>&gt;<i> what the screen seems to indicate.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So I need to get the USB connection working. Most of the gps units I
</I>&gt;<i> can test have only USB ports. Any guidance appreciated.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also, is there a specific test sequence that is used to test a
</I>&gt;<i> particular gps. Is there some sequence of commands I should be using
</I>&gt;<i> and then capture the output?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks!
