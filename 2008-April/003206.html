Yes, that's a mediatek device; we have a copy of that datasheet up on
the references page.

&gt;<i>  I'm not familiar with GPS hardware, but should gpsd support or at least

</I>&gt;<i>  driver? (intead of testing for all the others NMEA subtypes?).
</I>
Yes and no. If we know about a proprietary NMEA sentence, and we know
that a message is useful, then we'll parse it. Otherwise we ignore it.
That is very much a human-mediated process. Someone needs to read the
protocol specification and figure out how to patch in the useful bits.
Also, I'm not keen on hacking in specific device support without
actual hardware in hand.

One of the uses of a message is to probe/identify a device. For
example, non-prehistoric SiRF firmware has a very nice navigation
solution binary message; this message has the full navigation solution
in a single packet which makes the internal data handling much
cleaner. But this isn't correctly/completely implemented in all
versions, which is why we probe. Sometimes a message is good,
sometimes it's a pack of lies.

Similarly, Ashtech/Thales/MagellanPro receivers do have a single NMEA
message with a full navigation solution. In the case of the MTK chip,
there's no advantage to using the proprietary messages. There is no
single-sentence fix, so the generic NMEA is good enough.

Probing isn't totally necessary; we do have a protocol detection state
machine which can figure out what protocol is saying and pass it off
to the right packet decoder.

&gt;<i>  Anyway, gpsd seems to works ok with the device  since it defaults to
</I>&gt;<i>  NMEA (it sends the rest of the probes when connecting to gpsd and
</I>&gt;<i>  reopening the device).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  Thanks for any input since I'm just starting to learn about GPS soft+hard!
</I>
GPSD works because of the protocol sniffer; the probes are, in a way,
just icing on the cake.

GDB has a 'break' feature; why doesn't it have 'fix' too?
