<PRE>Hi - I'm having a problem getting gpsd to understand GGA and ZDA sentences
correctly.  I've got the output of an ASHTECH adu2 gps receiver wired up to
a serial repeater box that connects only the transmit and ground serial
lines (so gpsd can not talk back to my receiver).  My goal is to setup a gps
backed ntp server.

gpsd seems to have trouble getting time from my receiver...  It gets
position fine but it appears not to like the order in which the GGA and ZDA
sentences are output ...  Any ideas?  Output shown below...
