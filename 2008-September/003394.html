<PRE>To answer your first question, yes the default is localhost on port 2947 in
my experience.

It doesn't need to recognize gpsd, the client and the server communicate via
sockets. gpsd listens for connections on port 2947, the client then connects
to port 2947 and attempts to communicate. The client doesn't know that gpsd
is listening on the other end, it just assumes this. You could run gpsd on
any port that you would like, 2947 is just the default. I don't know if I
explained this very well but if you have questions let me know.

Also I don't know if there is a complete API available, but I imagine since
you have the gpsd library on your machine you could look through it and
figure out what functions are available to you. If you have any questions
let me know.

Subject: Re: [Gpsd-users] Reading GPSD Data from inside Python: SIMPLY WAY?

Thanks, Pete, for your very quick response!

As a matter of fact, in my Googling I had run across that very page, and it
looked deceptively simple.  In fact, it looked *too* simple to me to have a
hope of working (where was the rest of the code to make it work?).

Anyways, since you pointed it out, I gave it another look, and found that it
was very close to working for me (!).  I didn't see *any* reference to
host/port in the code (which I needed), so I took a guess and made this
small change:

session = gps.gps(&quot;192.168.1.104&quot;,&quot;2947&quot;)

I guess the default was host '127.0.0.1', so I needed to make it work for
*my* host :)

Then, to get rid of the loop so as to *just get a simple answer*, I hacked
and slashed the code to look like this:

import gps, os, time

session = gps.gps(&quot;192.168.1.104&quot;,&quot;2947&quot;)

while 1:
    os.system('clear')
    session.query('admosy')
    # a = altitude, d = date/time, m=mode,
    # o=postion/fix, s=status, y=satellites

    if session.fix.latitude != 0:
        print 'latitude    ' , session.fix.latitude
        print 'longitude   ' , session.fix.longitude
        print 'time utc    ' , session.utc, session.fix.time
        print 'altitude    ' , session.fix.altitude
        break

    time.sleep(3)

It ain't perfect, but it proved to me how *easy* it was to do this, and how
easy it will be to integrate into my own code.

I guess I am surprised that this was so easy -- is there a complete API
available for this?  How does this magic 'gps.gps' module work, and
recognize 'gpsd' (of all things)?
