There is code to handle this device's output, but unless we get test
reports we can't be sure it's working.

I think this is one of the fundamental problems of a community project
such as gpsd: things that developers are interested in and can test
get worked on. Users are welcome to submit patches for things the
developers aren't as interested in, or can't test. So certain areas
are very well supported and others stagnate. That's the way it goes
when you don't have a budget for a test lab.

Your TNT is a good example: it looks really neat, but without actual
hardware I can't/won't do much for it beyond checking that patches
compile.

I have a thousand dollar shopping list of various sensors I'd like to
get: u-blox antaris, thales ac12, fastrax itrax3, trimble copernicus &amp;
lassen iq ... I have references for these already but until I get
actual sensors, it's just interesting bedtime reading. The reason I
don't hack support for hardware without having the actual device handy
is that documentation is not always complete or accurate. Not always,
but often enough that I'd prefer to have a real device to test
against.

&gt;<i> I can provide you with the (attached) technical documentation of TNTC
</I>&gt;<i> that describes the NMEA sentences. Maybe we discuss that on gpsd-dev, I
</I>&gt;<i> remember there were other people using TNTC too.
</I>
If you like. For now, I'm treating this as a simple bug report: the
nmea parser does not seem to properly recognize the TNTHTM sentence.

&gt;<i> Thank you for your support.
</I>
To the entire user base: from a developer perspective, I'd like to see
more comments when I send big patches to the lists, or when I break
something. If you don't read diffs, at least read my comments and tell
me if I'm completely out-to-lunch when I make a suggestion. While
having a handful of us hacking our pet features into gpsd helps
improve it, proper real world testing and use cases are also extremely
valuable. When we commit, we're essentially signing off on the quality
of the code, and I'm sure none of us want to be expressing approval of
bad code.

GDB has a 'break' feature; why doesn't it have 'fix' too?
