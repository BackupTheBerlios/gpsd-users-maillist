<PRE>I've been a bit of an absent father lately, for which I apologize.  
Unfortunately, I can't promise no more month-long disappearances -- 
I'm lead or sole maintainer on over thirty other projects and over
a dozen FAQs and HOWTOs, and that's on top of the sooper seekrit 
legal-consulting gig -- and oh, yeah, did I mention the overhead of
being one of the principal ringleaders of a worldwide conspiracy?
(This mainly means a lot of people ranging from hackers to 
corporate CEOs and beyond come to me for advice.)

In fact, I know for sure that I'm going to be unavailable for a
couple of weeks in early 2007.  So this note is about project
governance and what to do when I'm gone.

The good news is that the project handled me being vanished for a
month extremely well.  I had 316 pieces of back mail when I came back,
and you guys had resolved the issues in all but about forty of them
without me.  Good going!  This is not an achievement to take for
granted -- we had almost no depth on the bench when Remco Treffkorn
handed me the baton in 2004.

Chris Kuethe and Gary Miller did an excellent job of fielding queries
and tweaking the code, not making a single decision with which I would
more than quibble.  So I'm making it as official as these things get:
these men are my lieutenants. I've learned to trust their judgment.  When
I'm not here, they get to make the calls.  I won't reverse them
without strong cause and a very detailed explanation.

At this point, I consider Chris slightly senior to Gary on grounds of
both breadth of code contributions and more intimate knowledge of GPS
arcana like the details of ISGPS -- indeed, Chris groks these things
rather better than I do.  But Gary's laudable conservatism and mature
design judgment is a valuable check against charging off in mistaken
directions.  When he thinks something is a bad idea, I've noticed he's
invariably correct (and that includes *my* bad ideas).  So I listen to
Gary very carefully, and I think everyone else should too.

I'm also advising both Chris and Gary to listen attentively when 
Rob Janssen speaks up.  He's a bit prickly at times but he's smart
and a valuable critic.  I'd give him commit privileges in a second 
if he'd take them.

(In case it isn't obvious, I've always believed that what *I* bring to
this project is not GPS domain expertise but an ability to see larger
possibilities in software design space that other people miss.  My
main achievements here are the driver structure, multisession support, the
packet sniffer, and the zero-configuration machinery -- all results of
thinking creatively about code architecture rather than about the
specifics of GPS-land.)

I'm officially giving Chris and Gary (and this is new) release
authority.  We need to be able to ship point releases when I'm
distracted.  The procedure I suggest is that when Gary and Chris agree
we're ready to ship, and I don't pop up and say &quot;No, I want to wait on
X&quot;, we do it.

None of this means I'm planning to disappear permanently, stop
contributing code, or stop doing the project-lead thing when a final
decision on a major issue needs to be made.  If nothing else, we're
going to have to deal with the command-set extension problem at some
point in the not too distant future, and that is a design issue on
which *I* have superior domain expertise and intend to make the final
call.  

But it's not before time to make sure that the project can not only
thrive and ship releases in my absence but knows it can do so, with
the lieutenants comfortable in their authority and legitimacy.  Of
course, this also implies a line of succession in the event that I
*do* have to go away permanently, and that's a good thing too.  I
doubt I'm surprising anyone by anointing Chris and Gary, which is
one of the signs that it's the right thing to do.

Finally, thank you, everybody -- developers and users -- for making
this the most fun project I've ever been associated with.  I continue
to be impressed at the quality of the bug reports and code submissions
we get, and how remarkably little heartburn they cause me given the
poorly-documented hardware and complex problems we have to cope
with,
