Indeed.

In this case the fixes did actually line up with my location quite
nicely. Which was lucky. Very Lucky. Much like I mentioned on the dev
list, you need to be mindful of your significant figures. If my
estimated positional error is in the tens of meters, it doesn't make
much sense to believe your decimeters.

The point there is that we're now getting very affordable chipsets
that are both good at finding a signal where signal has no rightful
place to be, and then hanging on to it. Mature that technology 3
years, add some dual-frequency support, some more magic I can't think
of right now,  and I think we have sunspot-proof GPS.

Plus, we'll probably have more accessible A-GPS in our phones and more
location-based services. But until such time as I get NMEA out of my
phone, it's just a battery waster.

GDB has a 'break' feature; why doesn't it have 'fix' too?
