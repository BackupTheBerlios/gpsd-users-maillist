I see you have had a similar experience to mine.  I just upgraded my
Sprint phone service for a short while.  After days of work with tech
support I returned the piece of shit Sprint Fusic.

I have been using the Sprint Vision server since 1993.  For $10/mo.  I
can connect my phone to my laptop and get about 110kbps anywhere I have
a Sprint signal.  I love it.  I tell all my techy friends tIo get it.  I
tell all my clients I have it just in case their is an emergency.  But
times have changed and the new options at Sprint just suck.

Now Sprint (and others) have the next generation.  Sprint calls it Power
Vision and you are supposed to be able to get 2mbps download out of it.
Hah.  Unlike other modem and mobile solutions, Power Vision, at least on
the Fusic, does not do PPP.  It requires a special protocol module on
top of the USB driver.  It only runs on windows, and even on Windows it
crashes a lot.  Since the phone uses some undocumented protocol there is
no way to think of getting it to work on anything else.

So, the A-GPS looks cool, maybe that is enough reason to keep the phone.
Except, as Chris pointed out, there is no way to get to the data.  They
want you to spend $10/mo to use their slow downloadable maps.  Ugh.  No
way to work with Google Maps..

These A-GPS are in the phone so they can track you (mandated by US Gov),
and maybe get some money from you.  For $120 a simple map program costs
a year I could by a nice pocket GPS w/o the problems.

So, I figure I just get, or write, a J2EE program to get the data.
Wrong.  There is no J2EE support on most newer sprint phones.  THere
is some crap that needs a $1k SDK to write and run.  Then you need to
pay many $k more to Sprint to &quot;test&quot; your program.  Then you have to
pay Verisign to sign your program.  Only then will it run on the Fusic.
Repeat for each binary version.  This is just way too greedy for my
taste.

So, no mobile access, very few programs for it, no useable A-GPS, but it
is still sort of a cool looking phone.  Then it dies within a few days.

Good thing, a dead phone is real easy to return and I am now back to plain
Vision.

&lt;/rant&gt;
