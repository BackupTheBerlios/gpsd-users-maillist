<PRE>Alastair Battrick &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-users">al at battrick.org</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> I have a problem with gpsd and my gps unit. I am using gpsd 2.28 
</I>&gt;<i> installed via rpm on a RH Fedora 4 box. The USB GPS unit is apparenly 
</I>&gt;<i> based on an Evermore chip, this one:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.mapfactor.com/products/gps/mpfc22usb.html">http://www.mapfactor.com/products/gps/mpfc22usb.html</A>
</I>
Evermore chip in NMEA mode.  We're working on Evermore binary support now.

&gt;<i> The problem I am having: When I connect to the daemon via telnet, the 
</I>&gt;<i> first 'P' or 'O' always gives a &quot;GPSD,P=?&quot; response, but subsequent 
</I>&gt;<i> requests work fine. If I quit from telnet and then reconnect, the first 
</I>&gt;<i> request is again met with an unknown response, but further requests work 
</I>&gt;<i> fine. The time left between any of these requests does not seem to matter
</I>
(Eric stares at the code and thinks for a while...)

Hm.  Thank you, you've just turned up a minor bug in the architecture,
To understand what's going on, you need to know that gpsd does not
immediately assign you a GPS from its pool of known devices when you
connect your client.  Rather, it waits until you issue a command that
requires GPS information.

The reason for this goes back to when I added multi-device support in 2.21, 
I realized then that what the client might want to do is list available
GPSes (with K) and choose one (with F).  There is also at least one other
command, L, that doesn't require a GPS.  And in general, waiting until 
a GPS is really needed to wake one up is a good idea -- saves power,
which can be important because GPS-equipped computers are more than
likely running off a battery.

So I deferred binding the device.  Your first P command triggers the
action of binding a GPS to your channel, but *at that time* no GPS is
yet bound.  The GPS doesn't have a fix, so you get ?.  But by the time
of your *next* request gpsd has polled the daemon and has a fix.

I hadn't noticed that deferring binding guaranteed a first P response
of ? previously because the test clients all use watcher mode.  In
watcher mode you get 'O' updates whenever the GPS ships a recognized
sentence.  The old-style individual requests are obsolete, really.

I'm divided in my mind whether to fix this bug or document it.  I suppose
I could make the device-binding logic do an immediate poll of the
device it binds.  That would complicate the code some.  Not sure
it's worth it.
