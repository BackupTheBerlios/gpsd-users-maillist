<PRE>maillist &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-users">maillist at boilerbots.com</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> It is me again with another issue. With the high data rates my GPS is 
</I>&gt;<i> producing it appears that sometimes the input buffer overflows and it 
</I>&gt;<i> crashes. I looked at the code and can't see anything obvious that would 
</I>&gt;<i> cause it to crash and haven't tried to catch it yet with a debugger.
</I>
I've stared at the code for a while myself, and I don't think it's the 
input buffer itself.  More likely it's some auxiliary buffer that is not
correctly scaled to the input buffer size.

Could I possibly get you to compile with MAX_PACKET_LENGTH = 196 and then
run under gdb long enough to crash gpsd?  I want to fix the underlying bug
rather than the symptom, and I don't have a 20Hz GPS to test with.

(Wherever did you get such a beast, anyway?)
 
&gt;<i> Anyway, what it looks like is that sometimes a long/slow context switch 
</I>&gt;<i> will cause the next read from the serial device to be very big. I 
</I>&gt;<i> sometimes see a read of 250 characters or more. This exceeds the size of 
</I>&gt;<i> the input buffer because it already contained partial packet data.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I have re-defined MAX_PACKET_LENGTH to 512 and I have not yet had a crash.
</I>
That wasn't the right define to tweak, I don't think.  Here's what I did:

I believe you.  My concern is that I want to harden the code so it will
handle arbitrary data rates, not just balloon some buffers hoping the 
overrun condition will never actually hit.

Replies to your previous two messages are coming.
