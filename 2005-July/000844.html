<PRE>I have backed the attempt to autoconfigure DBUS out of configure.ac
following reports from Gary Miller, Rob Janssen, and Wolfgang
Rupprecht that it broke their compiles.  You'll have to configure
DBUS manually until somebody figures out how to tes for DBUS headers
in a way that is distro-independent and DBUS-version-independent.

Wolfgang and I are making excellent progress on the RTCM decoder.
I expect to have autodetection of RTCM streams working within the
next week.  

Petr Slansky is hacking away at the Evermore driver and Oleg Gusev at
the iTrax one.  Neither seems likely to take much longer to get to
production status.

I have no near-term plans to ship a release.  When any two of the
three pending drivers (iTrax, Evermore, RTCM) land, I'll revisit that
and consider whether to ship immediately or wait on the third.

** Bugs in gpsd and its clients:

*** EPH and EPV reports are zeroed too often in the TSIP driver 

There is some bad interaction between the policy code in
libgpsd_core.c and the TSIP driver that we haven't figured out.

This may be a symptom of more general problems in data management
on devices that ship several sentences of fix and related data
per cycle.  It does not affect devices speaking SiRF or Zodiac or 
Garmin-binary protocol.

*** PPS code is flaky, possibly due to a pthreads bug

Some code attempting to terminate the PPS-monitoring thread when there
is no DCD (e.g., on a USB device) seems to have tickled some kind of
bug in pthreads -- termination seems to close the GPS device or
otherwise do something nasty to the serial I/O layer.  

The default build has ENABLE_PPS off until we figure this one out.

*** First packet from each device may be getting junked

Rob Janssen reports
&gt;<i> As the code is now (and has been as long as I have been hacking drivers)
</I>&gt;<i> the first packet received is junked somewhere before the parser is called.
</I>
I'm going to look into this one shortly.

*** There's a report that RoyalTek support broke between 2.25 and 2.28 

There's a report that RoyalTek support broke between 2.25 and 2.28 by
David Mandala &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-users">davidm at them.com</A>&gt;.  His workaround is to condition out
SiRF-II support; it works OK in NMEA mode.  He has undertaken to
pin down the SVN revision that broke things after OLS.
