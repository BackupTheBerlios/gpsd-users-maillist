<PRE>I've shipped 2.27.  Here's what I see as the roadmap for 2.28:

** Nail down Daryl Ross's SiRF bugs

Daryl Ross is reporting some very odd bugs on the BU-303 that I can't
reproduce with my almost identical test setup.  This bothers me, and
I want to understand why it is happening.

** Evermore driver

Petr Slansky wants Evermore chipset support.  His email reads as
though he is competent to write it.  An unanswered question is whether
there is a probe string that can elicit a PEMT or other unique
response from the Evermore chipset.

** SiRF firmware uploader

Chris Kuethe appears to be well along on this.  It is not yet 
resolved whether SiRF Technology will allow us to ship the 
binary loader code needed to do it.

** Decide what to do about RTCM support.

With WAAS and EGNOS delivering differential-GPS corrections in-band 
to most modern GPSes (and, in particular, to SiRF GPSses) there may
no longer be any point to supporting out-of-band RTCM104 and DGPSIP.

If there is still a point to this, here is the elegant way to do it:

1) Add code to packet.c that can recognize RTCM104 data packets.  This
   would be the hard part -- that format is *nasty*.

2) Write a trivial RTCM104 driver that just copies recognized packets
   into a save buffer.  Now we have RTCM104 sessions integrated into
   the gpsd architecture; we can hand RTCM104 sources like DGPS radios 
   to gpsd on the command line or via the control socket, just like GPSes.

3) Arrange for packets from any attached RTCM104 sessions to get
   automatically copied from their save buffers to any GPSes attached.

4) When there are attached RTCM104 sources, tell the daemon to serve
   these packets on port 2101.  At this point we will have replaced
   dgpsip's server function, through not yet its RTCM dumper function.

5) Get rid of the -d option by hacking open_device() so that when it
   sees a command-line option of the form server:port (with no
   embedded backslashes) it opens a socket to read from that server.
   Now any GPS-packet and RTCM data sources given on the command line
   can be remote as well as local.

6) Write a rtcmmon equivalent to sirfmon that disassembles and dumps
   RTCM packets.

The day will come when the mystical generation of Jesus by the Supreme
Being as his father, in the womb of a virgin, will be classed with the
fable of the generation of Minerva in the brain of Jupiter.
