<PRE>Things are quiet.  No known bugs are outstanding.  No urgent fixes have been
received since 2.28.

One report of hotplug troubles on Debian needs investigation.  I also
need to look at Daryl Ross's logs re the 10-second-lag phenomenon.
I'm not expecting serious difficulties with either.  I do not,
accordingly, have any immediate plans for a point release.

Changes since 2.28:

* I have cleaned up the internal error modeling.  All drivers now
  report error estimates with 95% confidence intervals.  Furthermore
  the confidence interval to be used as a dilution factor is now a
  #define set in a single spot in gpsd.h.

* I have cleaned up the driver structures, moving some things from
  the public gpsdata_t structure into private driver-specific storage
  in gps_device_t or driver-local variables.

* I have made it possible to compile the daemon without NMEA support.
  While this is unlikely to be hugely useful, putting these #ifdefs
  in place is documentation of the code partitioning.

* I have added a driver prototype file to the distribution, and
  extensively revised the hacking guide.

* I have added untested support for Sony CXD2951 GPS chips.  This
  is pretty trivial, just an initializer string that suppresses
  some sentences we don't want.

* Petter Reinhold sent a patch that fixes the configure script
  to autodetect DBUS libraries and link them if present.

Current projects:

* Petr Slansky is finishing the driver for Evermore chipsets that
  I started.  Unlike me, he has test hardware.

* Chris Kuethe seems to be well along towards a SiRF firmware loader.

* Amaury Jacquot has promised a manual page for his gpxlogger code.
  When I get this, it will move out of contrib and into the clients
  RPM.

* Rob Janssen is supposed to be trying to fix the PPS-thread code.

* I'm expecting Gary Miller to write gpspipe documentation when it
  isn't so nice outside :-).

Things nobody has tackled yet:

* RINEX dumping.  After researching the matter. I'm now convinced that
  this belongs in the daemon, mainly because the binary drivers are 
  already doing the packet-cracking needed to extract range/phase/PRN
  info.

* RTCM104. I'm now convinced this is worth supporting, but have
  no desire to write the RTCM104 decoder part myself.

I will start thinking about a point release when one of the following
happens: (1) a serious bug fix needs to be pushed out, (2) the
Evermore driver gets finished, (3) the firmware loader gets
finished.
