&gt;<i> Gary - I can't help you with your problem, but I can tell you why this

Well, it was my problem really

&gt;<i> The GPS has an &quot;almanac&quot; inside it, so it can calculate the correct location
</I>&gt;<i> of satellites in the near future.  When you start the GPS it will listen for
</I>&gt;<i> the satellites that should be visible [1].
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Since the GPS is inside or in another location with poor coverage, it can't
</I>&gt;<i> find the satellites it is expecting.  So after a while (90 seconds for mine)
</I>&gt;<i> the GPS will do a lengthy recalculate of the perceived out of date almanac.
</I>&gt;<i> On my techway POS USB GPS, this takes 3.5 to 4.5 hours!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So I've learned to only connect the GPS unit once outside. Hanging the GPS
</I>&gt;<i> out the window gave marginal results.
</I>
With my Garmin GPS II, if it can not get a valid position it will ask
after some time if I want to re-init, a kind of cold start which takes a
long time, or want to chose a country from a list, a somewhat less cold
start which does not take as long, or just go on acquiring data from the
satellites. I always choose this last possibility, and then it will find
a position. It can take 5 minutes or 3 hours, but it will not
recalculate the almanac.

Where I use my gps indoors I might have a good reception for hours,
sometimes up to 6 satellites, but sometimes there is reception of only 1
or 2 satellites, which also can take hours. It just depends on ???

I now suspect the main problem is in the hotstart script of the debian
package of gpsd 2.28. If I do &quot;ps aux | grep gpsd&quot; some time after
plugging in the gps I still see the hotplug script running and for
instance xgps will hang during start up. If I then do &quot;killall gpsd&quot; and
then start gpsd again xgps will work, kismet will work and most of the
times gpsdrive will work too, allthough there seems to be a problem
there too. Xpgs and Kismet might work, with a report of 4 satellites,
and gpsdrive might report 0/0 satellites. I then will just have to stop
everything again, start gpsd and kismet again, and then gpsdrive might
work.

The hotplug scripts are in python and I have never done any programming
in python, but I will dive into it and maybe find where things go wrong.
I wrote an earlier messages to the gpsd-users list, subjest &quot;Debian gpsd
packages&quot; where I reported a problem with the gpsd.hotplug script.

BTW is there a way to get some debug output from the gpsd.hotplug
script?
