</I>&gt;<i> Hm.  Thank you, you've just turned up a minor bug in the architecture,
</I>&gt;<i> To understand what's going on, you need to know that gpsd does not
</I>&gt;<i> immediately assign you a GPS from its pool of known devices when you
</I>&gt;<i> connect your client.  Rather, it waits until you issue a command that
</I>&gt;<i> requires GPS information.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The reason for this goes back to when I added multi-device support in 2.21, 
</I>&gt;<i> I realized then that what the client might want to do is list available
</I>&gt;<i> GPSes (with K) and choose one (with F).  There is also at least one other
</I>&gt;<i> command, L, that doesn't require a GPS.  And in general, waiting until 
</I>&gt;<i> a GPS is really needed to wake one up is a good idea -- saves power,
</I>&gt;<i> which can be important because GPS-equipped computers are more than
</I>&gt;<i> likely running off a battery.
</I>
However, if you know you only have one device and battery power isn't a
problem (like mine), you can always start gpsd with the '-n' switch.

&gt;<i> I'm divided in my mind whether to fix this bug or document it.  I suppose
</I>&gt;<i> I could make the device-binding logic do an immediate poll of the
</I>&gt;<i> device it binds.  That would complicate the code some.  Not sure
</I>&gt;<i> it's worth it.
</I>
I'm not sure it needs to be fixed, as you said, watcher mode is probably
better as then you only need 1 command to get all the information the
gps can supply instead of having to send 8 different commands. Might be
worth documenting though :)
