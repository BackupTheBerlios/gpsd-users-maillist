<PRE>The feature I've been pounding on for over a week is finally in place.
RTCM-104 is now a fully-supported device type. This means that if you hand
your gpsd a tty with a DGPS radio connected to it:

* the RTCM-104 data stream coming over the link will be automatically 
  recognized as what it is,

* the DGPS corrections from it will automatically be fed to every 
  attached GPS that has the capability to use them,

* If you tie your client to a device emitting RTCM-104 data with an F=
  command, you can enable raw mode to see the correction data in a
  readable format documented on the new rtcm-104(5) manual page.

More features to come shortly:

1) When there are attached RTCM104 sources, the daemon will serve
   these packets on port 2101.  At this point we will have replaced
   dgpsip's server function.

2) Make the client library able to read RTCM data served from the daemon.

3) Get rid of the -d option by hacking open_device() so that when it
   sees a command-line option of the form server:port (with no
   embedded backslashes) it opens a socket to read from that server.
   Now any GPS-packet and RTCM data sources given on the command line
   can be remote as well as local.

4) Make RTCM encoding work with an 'invert' option to rtcmdecode.

Props to Wolfgang Rupprecht, who supplied the RTCM-104 decoder and
cooperated with me in the tricky surgery required to integrate it.
