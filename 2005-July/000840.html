<PRE>Hi folks, 

This may be the lamest bug report I've ever put in but I have confirmed
it does not work correctly several times so here goes.

Upgraded to gpsd 2.28 from 2.25 (I think) using a RoyalTek RGM-2000 USB
GPS. I have udev installed and whenever the GPS in plugged in it gets 2
devices /dev/ttyUSB? and /dev/gps.

If gpsd is compiled with the Sirf binary support it detects that the gps
is indeed an Sirf chipset and switches to it. Sometimes (very rarely) it
gets it correct and works. Most of the time it gets it wrong and in
debug mode says unknown format for the Sirf input. (This did work on the
earlier version of gpsd). If I rebuild gpsd without Sirf support and
force the device back into NEMA mode all works as expected.

An additional data point for what it's worth, Most of the time (99%)
what ever that gpsd does to the gps it requires unplugging the gps and
replugging it before sirfmon will connect to it directly to kick it back
into NEMA mode. 

This is odd no doubt but it's repeatable, I've spent the last two days
tracking this down as I thought the problem was in my code, but once I
recompiled leaving Sirf mode out of gpsd my app runs normally again.

Very very odd. Sorry I wish I had more data but I don't. If you would
like anything collected just tell me what and how to collect it and I
will.

Cheers,

David
