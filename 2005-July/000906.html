<PRE>I think I solved this problem:

My solution in packet.c is to use inbufptr to point to the current 
position in the input buffer that is next to be parsed. Then only use 
inbuflen to track the end of the input buffer and use this to add new 
incoming data. Then when a packet is excepted and that data removed, put 
a &quot;break&quot; statement to exit the while loop so that packet can be sent 
out. This only required changes in a few locations and it seems to work.

Now for my next problem......

</I>&gt;<i> I got this gps that outputs sentences at 20Hz. So with several of the

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What I see it that the function packet_parse() has a problem with the

</I>&gt;<i> there isn't enough data for anything else to happen.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sometimes in my situation it happes that what is just read into the 
</I>&gt;<i> buffer is the final remaining piece of one sentence and the a whole 
</I>&gt;<i> complete new sentence (this usually occurs when the next sentence is a 
</I>&gt;<i> short one). When this happens the while loop with identify the end of 
</I>&gt;<i> the first sentence and accept the data but it will then continue in 
</I>&gt;<i> the while loop and accept the next sentence, causing the previous one 
</I>&gt;<i> to be lost.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Normally this almost goes un-noticed except when it happens during a 
</I>&gt;<i> GSA or other multi-part message. Sometimes one piece of the GSA is 
</I>&gt;<i> lost and then poof, gpsd exits.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You can probably solve this gracefully I hope. Meanwhile I am going to 
</I>&gt;<i> hack on it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am including some output showing where this failure occurred. You 
</I>&gt;<i> will see the packet accepted, discarded then another immediately 
</I>&gt;<i> accepted and discarded. Only the final packet is sent out, the GSV 3rd 
</I>&gt;<i> sentence, loosing the 2nd sentence.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks,
