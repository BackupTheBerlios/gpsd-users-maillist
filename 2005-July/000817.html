Working on it. I don't feel like selling any more of my soul to the
devil today, so I'll avoid the use of bold, blinking, red 144pt caps
for this:

=====================================
Warning - this is highly untested. You could nuke your reciever while
flashing it, just like I killed 2 of mine. New firmwares, while
bringing shiny new features, can also radically alter the behaviour of
your receiver (like setting the default protocol to <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-users">SiRF at 38400</A>). I
don't know that I can redistribute some of the required binary parts
and I haven't received even a preliminary &quot;that's probably not
completely wrong&quot; from SiRF. This is a path of great peril down which
you travel.
=====================================

So yeah, I'd love to have beta testers, but be warned that I've
already lost 2 receivers to firmware flashing, I'm scared to lose
another, and while I'm trying to be as safe as I can, I'm not
responsible if you nuke your receiver.

With that out of the way, here's a brief status report:
* Only POSIX standard interfaces are used. it should just work on your
favorite linux or bsd or unix.
* The software contains only original code written by be (except for
one little bit I ripped out of gpsd's sirf.c) even though I have
access to the source for SiRF's flash driver. Thus, it is free of IP
entanglements and encumbrances.
* I have some magic in place to allow the firmware to boost the port
speed on the fly, while flashing to minimize the write time
* The binary blob running on the receiver only supports transferring
S-records, and S-record loading is interactive. I don't have the Arm
Development Studio, and ADS seems to be required to build this sort of
binary blob, so I can't build a better one of my own. and I hear ADS
is really expensive.
* Best time to push a new firmware across to my simulator is 0:01:33.
I suspect that'll go up to about 0:01:45 once I put all the error
checking and interactivity in.

GDB has a 'break' feature; why doesn't it have 'fix' too?
