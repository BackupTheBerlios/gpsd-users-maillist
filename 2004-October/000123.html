<PRE>Hi folks,

I've run into a couple of problems while trying to build 2.2 on Mac 
OS X 10.3 (Darwin), but the main reason I'm trying to build 2.2 is to 
find out whether it fixes some bugs in the output of some basic 
commands.  The first error I got was while trying to &quot;make&quot;, in 
libgpsd_core.c, line 37, &quot;implicit declaration of calloc&quot;... which of 
course means the library header containing calloc hadn't been 
#included.  The fix for that was as simple as adding

#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

to the list in libgpsd_core.c

Similarly, while compiling gps.c, it ran into a whole bunch of 
implicit declarations, this time from missing stdio.h

gpsd.c ended up with a huge number of includes missing, and the only 
way I could find them all was to compare it against the same file 
from version 2.0.  I added the following includes:

sys/ioctl.h
sys/types.h
netinet/in.h
netinet/tcp.h

Perhaps all of those weren't necessary, but at least it gets a clean 
compile with them in.

Anyhow, I now have it running, and am pleased to report that it's now 
reporting correct altitude in response to an &quot;A&quot; command (rather than 
just zero, as seemed to be the case in 2.0).  However, the &quot;Q&quot; 
command does not give an accurate report of the number of satellites 
used for the fix (which is the only meaningful number of satellites 
to report).  For some reason I can't figure out, it seems always to 
report &quot;12&quot; (which is the number of channels my GPS unit has) rather 
than the actual number of satellites used for the fix.  The number 
which *should* be returned by &quot;Q&quot; can either be found in the GPGGA or 
GPGSA sentences:

$GPGGA,123519,4807.038,N,01131.324,E,1,08,0.9,545.4,M,46.9,M, , *42
                                        ^^ (8 satellites)

$GPGSA,A,3,04,05,,09,12,,,24,,,,,2.5,1.3,2.1*39
            ^^ ^^  ^^ ^^   ^^    (5 satellites)

I would suggest GGA is the best place to get it, as it's just given 
(rather than needing gpsd to count them).

Anyhow, hope that helps make 2.3 even better... fantastic work, guys!

Cheers,
Robin
