<PRE>I ran a couple of tests over the weekend to see if I just remembered the
new gpsd behavior incorrectly.

What I found out is that both versions 1.97 and 1.98 did actually let go
of the serial port when the last connection drops.  Again to tell this
I'm looking at a GPS status light on my CF card that goes out when the
serial port is unused.

Since the source to 2.0 was not available, I could only test 2.1 and
2.2.  Both of these no longer turn off the CF card light when the last
connection to gpsd closes.  In both cases if I kill the running gpsd the
light turns off as it did in the older 1.98 and before versions.

I hope some of this helps.  If you can give me some idea of what to look
at I might be able to debug this myself and just send a patch.  That
patch of code in 2.2 is quite confusing and I'm not sure I want to just
start mucking around with it.  It's hard to believe that serial
communications are still one of the hardest things to get working.  I'm
so glad we have LANs now, and I hardly every have to worry about all
that serial stuff anymore!
