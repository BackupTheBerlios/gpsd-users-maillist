There was a bit of sarcasm in there. My apologies. I just hadn't heard
any test reports from mac users.... If you have the time, I wouldn't
mind getting frequent test reports (it still works / you broke it)
when something drastic changes in gpsd or you apply OS patches. In
fact, that'd be really handy.

Next time we post &quot;OS $foo is not supported because of $problem.&quot; it'd
really be great if $foo  users could do some tests and make a liar out
of me. For better or worse, we calls 'em as we sees 'em - and that
means we'll say an entire OS is unsupported based on one or two
misbehaving machines, pending evidence to the contrary.

</I>
Mac OS X 10.4.8 (8L2127)

I have indications that it's just the prolific serial driver. I'll see
about getting my test system upgraded today. I have quite a few test
receivers I can play with, not so many different test operating
systems.

GDB has a 'break' feature; why doesn't it have 'fix' too?
