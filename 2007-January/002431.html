Eric and I have spoken with the gpsdx maintainer - he says he hasn't
done anything special to make it work, and he hasn't had any problems.
As for wanting someone to explain these apparently contradictory
assertions... here goes.

I'd received reports from our only current mac user (you seem to be
only the second person interested in running gpsd on a mac) that
select did not work. I have (root access to) a mac mini with a gps
plugged in, and select does not work.

On January 13, after communication with some of the Apple developers,
I filed a bug on this issue. I provided them with full diagnostics and
instructions for reproducing this, as well as a simple test case that
illustrates select() not working when the source tty is a PL2303 (the
limit of my test hardware). Thus far I have not heard back from the
developers, nor have I seen any action on my bug - it remains in the
&quot;open&quot; state.

Perhaps it's just a small segment of systems affected, but it affects
100% of my test systems (n=1), and at least 50% of other reporting mac
users (n=2). I'd very much like to retract the statement that we don't
support OS X, but until I've actually seen it work or at least have a
better understanding of exactly what is broken, I can't say that OS X
is supported. If it works for you a) consider yourself lucky, and b)
please detail for us your exact configuration so we know what systems
stand a reasonable chance of working.

GDB has a 'break' feature; why doesn't it have 'fix' too?
