Here's another take on it.  I think there are two main problems:

1) Getting all your stuff running on a computationally small system -
    not much CPU, not much memory.

2) Getting all your stuff running on a physically small and rugged
    system - fits in your pocket, survives being dropped.

The specs at the link Chris Kuethe posted ( <A HREF="http://zaurus.kd85.com/">http://zaurus.kd85.com/</A> )
seem to be comparable to about where Pentium II laptops were in 1997/
1998 or so.  This is interesting because if you ask around, you can
probably get a laptop like that for free or for 10 euros or whatever.
Then you can find out if you can get the code running on that kind
of system, and as a bonus, you get a keyboard you can actually type
on and a &quot;big&quot; display.  In my experience, unless your target system
is really really tiny, running a cross-compiler on a &quot;big&quot; computer
and then copying the executables over to the target just adds extra
work for not much gain.  If the code turns out to run well on the
laptop, you can be more confident that it will work before you spend
&quot;real money&quot; on a PDA-like device.

A point for developing on the target PDA-like device from the beginning
instead of an x86 laptop is that you won't ever have to port the code.
Computers that aren't desktop machines tend to have slightly weird
built-in peripherals, so you might have to spend a lot of time getting
the base OS to work on the x86 laptop instead of working on your code.
Also, it may be that you already know you can run the software on a
slow CPU with not much memory, and getting the physically small and
rugged device is more important.
