<PRE>Hi Everyone,

Well, I've been lurking for a while.  Figured it was to to make a first
post. :-)

Q:  Has anyone thought/tried to build location/position into the Linux
kernel, beyond the rather static &quot;timezone&quot;?

Here's the background thought-trail behind this question (and how it
applies to gpsd):

1.  I want to be reminded of errands and associated lists when near the
location in question.  It's the position-equivalent of a Calendar
alarm/reminder.

2.  ...and maybe there are also files I need to work on at the location,
like at work.  This sort of context-awareness could be built into each
application, but then I'd have to work support into each application
individually.  An easier way to fix this might be within the various file
browser API to at least add support to sort files by proximity.

3.  ...then I would need some sort of mechanism to track where a file was
created, modified and/or accessed.  That's an OS/Filesystem level of file
tracking.  The ext2/3 inode has ctime, atime, and mtime constructs to
track this info, so the logical thing to do is extend the file system to
also track &quot;clocation&quot;, &quot;alocation&quot;, and &quot;mlocation&quot;.

4.  ... exploring the kernel source, current_kernel_time() seems to be one
magic function used by filesystems to maintain inode time variables.  On
the other hand, &quot;timezone sys_tz&quot; appears to be a global
variable/structure.  What if the timezone were a function of real
position?

5.  ...when setting system timezone, the end user could either use the
traditional pick-a-timezone approach and default location coordinates
would be set behind the scenes, or one could specify coordinates and have
the timezone set automagically.

6.  ...or if GPS-enabled, any device, whether it's a laptop, desktop,
cellphone or PDA, could update it dynamically via gpsd.

...which is what led me to my question here, whether anyone has even tried
patching the kernel in this manner.

Thoughts?

Andrew.
