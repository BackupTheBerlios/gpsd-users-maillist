<PRE>I apologize for being missing for two days.  There was good reason.

Some of you may recall my friend Rob Landley making a guest
appearance on this list to argue against doing the multidevice feature.
He eventually came around to the conclusion that it wasn't a bad idea.
However, during our subsequent discussion of the right way to design
it, Rob pointed out two significant security problems with the F
command.

1) A malicious client with non-root access on the host could use F to
point gpsd at a spoof GPS that is actually a pty feeding bogus
location data.

2) A malicious client could use repeated probes of a target tty or
other device to cause data loss to other users.  This is a potential
remote exploit! Not too bad if the bytes he steals are your mouse, it
would just get jumpy and jerky -- but suppose they're from your disk
drive and sections drop out of a file you are retrieving for edit?

Note that potential bugs are not consequences of multi-device support,
but are implied by the ability to specify any path target for an F
command.

The conclusion was inescapable.  Switching among and probing devices
that gpsd already knows about can be an unprivileged operation, but 
editing gpsd's device list must be privileged.  Hotplug scripts 
should be able to do it, but ordinary clients should not.

I considered and rejected adding an autentication mechanism (can you
say &quot;can of big wriggly worms&quot;?).  Instead, I implemented a separate
control channel for the daemon, only locally accessible, only
recognizing &quot;add device&quot; and &quot;remove device&quot; commands. The hotplug
scripts have been appropriately modified.

The channel is a Unix-domain socket owned by root, so it has
file-system protection bits.  An intruder would need root permissions
to get at it, in which case you'd have much bigger problems than a
spoofed GPS.

As a side effect of this work, multi-device support is now almost
complete.  You can list the devices attached to a GPS with 'K' and
switch among them with 'F'.  

The only logic missing is that having a GPS yanked from under you by a
hotplug event should probably cause the daemon to hand you off to
another GPS if one is available.  I have not written that yet.

The code is in SVN head now, please test.

[W]hat country can preserve its liberties, if its rulers are not
