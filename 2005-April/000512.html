I hadn't intended to return to this thread until I had some substantive 
progress to report, but I just read 86 mails from this list after a brief 
absence, and most of them seem to have been started by my original post :-(

Gary, can I just confirm that your comment there is exactly what I meant to 
say. I didn't report a bug (at least, not in that part of the message), I 
only wanted to add to the record a report from an architecture that didn't 
seem to have been written about. Since the warnings were given, I mentioned 
them.

I'm nervous about raising my head at all in this expert company, but perhaps I 
can introduce a quote from 'info gcc' about what that warning means:

`-Wcast-align'
     Warn whenever a pointer is cast such that the required alignment
     of the target is increased.  For example, warn if a `char *' is
     cast to an `int *' on machines where integers can only be accessed
     at two- or four-byte boundaries.

To me, that says the compiler will issue the warning, even if it's possible to 
guarantee that the alignment will in fact be correct at run time. In other 
words, it is not saying that the code won't work, only that you asked for 
such warnings on the compile line and so you'll get them for each and every 
widening cast.

And while I'm here: Eric, some messages back you mentioned a report that zgcc 
didn't honour #pragma pack. I didn't mean to suggest that (assuming you were 
referring to my post), though I hadn't tested it. I have now tested it: here 
is the program.

#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

struct fred {
  char a;
  int b;
} x;

#pragma pack(1)
struct joe {
  char a;
  int b;
} y;

struct sam {
  char a;
  short b;
  char c;
} z;

int main() {
  printf(&quot;Diff %d\n&quot;,((int)&amp;x.b) - ((int)&amp;x.a));
  printf(&quot;Diff %d\n&quot;,((int)&amp;y.b) - ((int)&amp;y.a));
  printf(&quot;Diff %d\n&quot;,((int)&amp;z.c) - ((int)&amp;z.a));
  printf(&quot;z.b is %d\n&quot;,z.b);
}

On my Intel desktop, *and* on the Zaurus, it prints:

Diff 4
Diff 1
Diff 3
z.b is 0

(fred wasn't packed; joe and sam were.)

So I'd say that zgcc does recognise the pragma, and what's more, the Arm does 
seem happy about the non-alignment of the short in struct sam.

My humble conclusion: no need to change the code just yet. Wait til there's a 
processor that does insist on alignment (compare struct sam with struct 
cpo_sat_data in garmin.c), or one that is big-endian. When that does happen, 
I reckon there'll be not much choice except to recode with offsets and 
picking out bytes. But it doesn't look as though it's happened yet.

BTW, as well as short, I've also tried struct sam with int, float and double. 
They all worked ok.

Incidentally, since my last post I did get gpsd running. The problem was that 
the CF card needed to be woken up first (cardctl resume 0). My remaining 
problem is that if the Z suspends itself, gpsd appears to hang after the 
resume (though the card does wake up). After the last time, please let me 
make it clear that this is a work-in-progress comment and not a bug report, 
and it may have nothing to do with gpsd anyway! I'll look into it (but don't 
hold your breath while waiting) and let you know if I find anything that 
looks useful. But: on that architecture, it does run, and it does report 
messages correctly.

Hope (nay, pray) that this helps

John Foster
