neat stuff.

Well here in New Zealand is one place where we don't get it.

What you need to build your own DGPS base station (for post-processing):
 - an extra Garmin
 - software to save the raw Garmin protocol
 - a datalogger/laptop + car battery
 - a known survey benchmark pin where you can leave the recording gear
   or a friendly surveyor who'll make you one where it's convinent
 - a datalogger/laptop to record the raw stream from the moving receiver
 - software to process everything once you get home

What you need to build your own WAAS:
 - an atomic clock about the size of a VW bug
 - spooky RF antenna know-how
 - a rocket to put it into geosynchronous orbit
 - some sort of personal NORAD communications center to look after it
 - ...

;-)

[the above is to encourage folks to try, and to explain why it is not
unusual for far-off places to have DGPS coverage]


Chris:
&gt;<i> Nit-picking: WAAS is one SBAS system that covers North America. EGNOS
</I>&gt;<i> is the (unfinished) European equivalent. There are others, like
</I>&gt;<i> starfire, omnistar, cdgps... his receiver probably has a list of SBAS
</I>&gt;<i> PRNs that transmit a compatible signal, and he picked up the EGNOS
</I>&gt;<i> ones.
</I>
IIRC I can see the PRN of the Japanese MSAS sat, but my when I tell my
BU-353 SiRFstarIII puck to enable WAAS support nothing happens. my guess
is that while it is geosynchronous, it's aimed north. Even then I'd worry
that the ionospheric corrections applied would not be relevant so far
away from the intended target. shrug, hopefully the Australian gov't has
a cunning plan. In the end I guess you really need multi-band to get it
right...

Gary:
&gt;<i> You will get almost as good accuracy if you just get a recent WAAS
</I>&gt;<i> compatible GPS.
</I>
almost, but not quite. Especially if you lump RTK in with &quot;DGPS&quot;.
the more the better I suppose.... and yes, WAAS is certainly the simplest
way, if you can get it.
