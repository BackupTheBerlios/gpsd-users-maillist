<PRE>Hello everyone,

Just signed up to this group, I'm having difficulty getting 
a Garmin-USB18 gps receiver going [Toshita-A70 &amp; Suse-10.3].
It's my first gps ever.

I have the customary desktop battlegroup as well as this
laptop, tried things on both, discussed some issues on the 
gpsdrive list but up to this point my problems are perhaps 
more gpsd than gpsdrive.

I just finished a session on the laptop, outside, clear view 
of the sky above and even more so to the south. I took the 
time to paste out whatever I could so as to ask a question 
that might be easier to answer. I'm not all that familiar 
with linux, mostly just try whatever I can find on the net.
The Suse installation is quite up to date. The TOR daemon is 
started up on boot (in case it would be significant).

Any help would be appreciated, it looks like I haven't yet 
gotten to the point where the receiver itself would be in 
question.

TIA

Then on plugging-in the unit...

Note botom lines..

This is one thing I was NOT getting on the desktop, but I 
can't take it outside. The seemingly better desktop readout 
is pasted-in following that section.
