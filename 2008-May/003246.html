 &gt; &gt; thanks.  so i guess the question is, how much would having any
 &gt; &gt; one of these things help?  and, conversely, how much would giving
 &gt; &gt; the gps bad data (e.g., time off by a few seconds) hurt?  and
 &gt; &gt; which of these would give the biggest bang for the buck.
 &gt; 
 &gt; Could hurt a lot... like multiple tens of minutes if the firmware is
 &gt; really dumb.
 &gt; 
 &gt; Some receivers may keep trying with bad data indefinitely until you
 &gt; command them to do an auto-locate (cold start).
 &gt; 
 &gt; Time off by a few seconds should be manageable - guessing that'll hurt
 &gt; startup times by about as many seconds as time is off.

interesting.  i'm wondering if that explains some very slow
startups i've seen with my sirf III receiver.  the last time i
noticed it, the laptop and receiver, still connected, had been
inside (no fix) for several days.  it took at least 100 seconds
to get a fix when i took them outside, and i think i saw the time
(from the gps -- i was watching the satellite screen which
include &quot;gps time&quot;) jump when it got the fix.  i wonder if the
receiver's internal clock had drifted by a lot, causing it to
have trouble getting a fix.

i'm assuming an internal clock, to assist in warm-starts.
