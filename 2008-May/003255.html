 &gt; &gt; i've heard a couple of people lately say, effectively, this: 
 &gt; &gt;     &quot;Long lock-on times have been reduced considerably in the latest
 &gt; &gt;     generation of cheap GPS hardware.  Initializing with a good guess
 &gt; &gt;     makes it even faster, just a few seconds.&quot;
 &gt; 
 &gt; The notion that knowing position well reduces time to first fix to
 &gt; seconds doesn't quite make sense.  Most of my receivers store some data
 &gt; in non-volative memory to aid the next startup:
 &gt; 
 &gt;   almanac
 &gt;   last position
 &gt;   time
 &gt;   ephemeris

thank you.  you forced me to go and look up the difference between
almanac and ephemeris data.  (btw, i ended up at how-gps-works.com -- how
appropriate.)

 &gt; 
 &gt; I've seen the following terms used:
 &gt; 
 &gt;    cold start: no almanac/position/time.  Receiver searches for signals
 &gt;    until it finds one.  Then it knows time.  It waits for almanac and
 &gt;    ephemeris.  It can position once it has 4 sats with ephemeris, and
 &gt;    can find more sats efficiently with almanac and position.  Time to
 &gt;    first fix multiple minutes.
 &gt; 
 &gt;    warm start: has almanac, approximate position, approximate time
 &gt;    (receiver has been on within the last month(?) or so, but not the
 &gt;    last 2 hours).  Can find sats efficiently by knowing what's above the
 &gt;    horizon, and approximate doppler shift.  I typically see satellites
 &gt;    acquired in several seconds in this condition, but they aren't usable
 &gt;    for navigation due to lack of ephemeris.  Time to first fix typically
 &gt;    35 seconds if not moving and clear sky (5 to acquire, 30 to wait for
 &gt;    ephemeris).  If moving, can take minutes due to interruption of
 &gt;    ephemeris data - if I start driving right away I often get on the

thanks for this as well -- i hadn't ever quite understood why fixes
took so much longer while moving.  this makes sense.

 &gt;    order of several km before acquisition, and it usually happens either
 &gt;    on a clear stretch of road with good sky view or waiting for stop
 &gt;    light or stop sign.
 &gt; 
 &gt;    hot start: has warm start data plus ephermeris (receiver has been on
 &gt;    within the last hour or so).  I typically see satellites acquired in
 &gt;    several seconds (same as warm), but they are immediately usable -
 &gt;    time to first fix might be 5 seconds.
 &gt; 
 &gt; So it might make sense to send approximate position, time and almanac to
 &gt; a receiver which is in cold start mode.  Position only needs to be good
 &gt; enough to know what's above the horizon and calculate doppler - being
 &gt; off 50 km or a minute is no big deal.
 &gt; 
 &gt; Beyond that, I'm skeptical that gpsd would often enough have fresh
 &gt; ephemeris, unless there's support to extract it and share it on the
 &gt; network - I could see maintaining it from a home receiver and squirting
 &gt; it into a car receiver on power up.

like this server, i guess:
    <A HREF="http://www.tdc.co.uk/index.php?key=ephemeris">http://www.tdc.co.uk/index.php?key=ephemeris</A>

for something like this to be practical, i guess gpsd would need to
be in contact with the ephemeris server within a couple of hours
of your needing cold start assistance.  and, the server would
need to be close enough to you for the information to be useful. 
i wonder what that distance limit is?
