<PRE>i'm a long-time gpsd user.

for years i've used an old Garmin III unit to drive my mapping
software.  it puts out NMEA, works well, and has always seemed to
lag &quot;real time&quot; by about a second -- i.e., the latence is
completely expected, given the serial protocol, etc.  (when i say
&quot;lags real-time&quot;, i mean that when i'm travelling, my moving map
s/w shows that i'm at an intersection about a second after i've
passed it.)

i've recently acquired two new GPS receivers.

one is a Sirf-III usb model from globalsat.  it, too, seems to
lag real-time by about a second.  it might be a tad better than
the older garmin unit, but i also changed laptops in the
meantime, so i suspect they're about the same.

the other recent acquisition, made in an attempt to reduce the
number of interconnects, is a bluetooth unit, an I-Blue 737.
it has an MTK chipset.  (the USB bluetooth adapter i use is a
D-Link DB-120, but i suspect that doesn't matter.) unlike my
other receivers, this one consistently lags by 4 or even 5
seconds.

when i first noticed this, i hooked up both the new devices to my
laptop, ran separate gpsd processes, and connected to each. 
watching the log output from the two connections, it was clear
that the timestamp values reported by the MTK unit were behind
those reported by the Sirf unit, by several seconds.  (i was
stationary, so i couldn't compare positions easily, and i was
only &quot;eye-balling&quot; the logs in any case, so it would have been
hard.)

so:  is it to be expected that some chipsets would have such long
latencies?  it almost feels like the kind of effect you'd get if
the designer was doing excessive position averaging, in order to
be more accurate, or to report less position &quot;wander&quot;.

i confess i'm disappointed, because the MTK bluetooth unit
appears to be more sensitive (seems to usually get more
satellites than the Sirf unit), and being wireless, is much more
convenient.  but the lag makes it much less practical for
on-the-fly navigation.

(it's possible that the latency is in the bluez bluetooth stack. 
i've asked about this scenario twice on the bluez list, and have
been met with utter silence.  frankly, the size of the delay
(seconds, not just milliseconds) makes me doubt that bluetooth is
the cause.)
