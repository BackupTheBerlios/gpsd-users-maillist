I think you probably can't use external DGPS sources with this
receiver. Check your receiver documentation to see if it supports
external RTCM input. I had an old etrex that could actually take RTCM.
If you're in north america you already get DGPS from WAAS. I'm going
to guess (based on your email) that you're in Italy, thus you should
be able to get EGNOS.

I just checked <A HREF="http://www.egnos-pro.esa.int/IMAGEtech/imagetech_realtime_html.html">http://www.egnos-pro.esa.int/IMAGEtech/imagetech_realtime_html.html</A>
 and I'm kind of shocked that EGNOS is *still* in test mode. Couldn't
they have just bought a some WAAS gear now that the FAA has it all
figured out, and leased some transponder time from InMarSat. Oh,
right.... Not-Invented-Here syndrome. Yes, that's my completely
unqualified opinion.

&gt;<i>  How can I resolve this?
</I>&gt;<i>  What kind of GPS can use with GPSD and NTRIP? Which GPS work with DGPS
</I>&gt;<i>  (NTRIP)?
</I>
With a few exceptions most receivers output position data on one port
and accept corrections on another. I think you'd be hard-pressed to
find a *chip* that doesn't accept RTCM input somehow. The big problem
is how to get the RTCM into the chip. Many OEM module vendors don't
hook up secondary ports (globalsat), or there's some other software
layer in the way (garmin).

SiRF chips have up to 4 ports and only one protocol (NMEA, SIRF, RTCM,
USER) can be active on a port at a given time. uBlox chips can run
multiple protocols (NMEA, UBX, RTCM, USER) on their multiple ports -
simultaneously. Motorola OnCore speaks NMEA or Binary on port1 only,
and receives RTCM on port2 only.

&gt;<i>  Thanks, I hope you can help me, is very important for me. I am currently

</I>
One thing you need to consider is the data flow. Currently GPSD can't
write NTRIP/DGPS/RTCM data back to a receiver. You'd have to do some
tricks with gpspipe to read the corrections and feed them to the com
port where the receiver's secondary input is connected. ick.

I think GPSD's fairly weak NTRIP support is strongly correlated with
the lack of motivation. Motivation is influenced by having hardware to
test with, having access to an NTRIP stream, and having a
local/relevant NTRIP server. In my case, i've got quite good coverage
from WAAS and I don't know of any nearby reference stations, and no
one's donated me any receivers that can generate RTCM corrections.

Alas, correction-generating receivers are pretty expensive, and I've
already sunk thousands of dollars in to buying hardware - my gps toy
budget is tapped out for a while.

GDB has a 'break' feature; why doesn't it have 'fix' too?
