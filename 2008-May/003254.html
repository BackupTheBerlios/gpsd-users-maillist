The notion that knowing position well reduces time to first fix to
seconds doesn't quite make sense.  Most of my receivers store some data
in non-volative memory to aid the next startup:

  almanac
  last position
  time

  ephemeris

I've seen the following terms used:

   cold start: no almanac/position/time.  Receiver searches for signals
   until it finds one.  Then it knows time.  It waits for almanac and
   ephemeris.  It can position once it has 4 sats with ephemeris, and
   can find more sats efficiently with almanac and position.  Time to
   first fix multiple minutes.

   warm start: has almanac, approximate position, approximate time
   (receiver has been on within the last month(?) or so, but not the
   last 2 hours).  Can find sats efficiently by knowing what's above the
   horizon, and approximate doppler shift.  I typically see satellites
   acquired in several seconds in this condition, but they aren't usable
   for navigation due to lack of ephemeris.  Time to first fix typically
   35 seconds if not moving and clear sky (5 to acquire, 30 to wait for
   ephemeris).  If moving, can take minutes due to interruption of
   ephemeris data - if I start driving right away I often get on the
   order of several km before acquisition, and it usually happens either
   on a clear stretch of road with good sky view or waiting for stop
   light or stop sign.

   hot start: has warm start data plus ephermeris (receiver has been on
   within the last hour or so).  I typically see satellites acquired in
   several seconds (same as warm), but they are immediately usable -
   time to first fix might be 5 seconds.

So it might make sense to send approximate position, time and almanac to
a receiver which is in cold start mode.  Position only needs to be good
enough to know what's above the horizon and calculate doppler - being
off 50 km or a minute is no big deal.

Beyond that, I'm skeptical that gpsd would often enough have fresh
ephemeris, unless there's support to extract it and share it on the
network - I could see maintaining it from a home receiver and squirting
it into a car receiver on power up.

Then, there's getting accurate enough clock to aid acquisition from a
few seconds down to something smaller, and I suspect that's highly
receiver dependent.  100m of position is only 300ns, so this should
really be a clock issue.
