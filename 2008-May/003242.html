 &gt; &gt; i've heard a couple of people lately say, effectively, this:
 &gt; &gt;    &quot;Long lock-on times have been reduced considerably in the latest
 &gt; &gt;    generation of cheap GPS hardware.  Initializing with a good guess
 &gt; &gt;    makes it even faster, just a few seconds.&quot;
 &gt; &gt;
 &gt; &gt; does gpsd &quot;initialize with a good guess&quot;?  if it doesn't, could it
 &gt; &gt; help?
 &gt; 
 &gt; It doesn't do that, but it could help. Of course doing that may or may
 &gt; not be possible for a given receiver configuration.
 &gt; 
 &gt; When you have some state to load, that's called ... something other
 &gt; than a cold start. In a cold start the receiver has to figure out what
 &gt; time it is, what PRNs are visible, where it is, and some other stuff.
 &gt; Anything you can do to prevent it from having to deduce these things
 &gt; will speed up fix times. Eventually you get to do what SiRF calls a
 &gt; &quot;snap start&quot; - other vendors call it different things - but for that
 &gt; to work you need to know where you are already, you need to have a
 &gt; fresh ephemeris loaded, you need to know the time to about 1ms, and
 &gt; you need to have the onboard oscillator calibrated. It's basically a
 &gt; question of &quot;how fast can you re-acquire if I preload all your
 &gt; internal state?&quot;

thanks.  so i guess the question is, how much would having any
one of these things help?  and, conversely, how much would giving
the gps bad data (e.g., time off by a few seconds) hurt?  and
which of these would give the biggest bang for the buck.
