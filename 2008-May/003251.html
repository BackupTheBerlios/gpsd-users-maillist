It's called &quot;the control socket&quot; and it still exists. Have a look at
sirfmon to see how it can use the control socket to send bytes to the
gps. This same mechanism can send arbitrary bytes to an arbitrary
device - you could probably use it to bootstrap a device.

Second, have a look at the manual for your particular receiver. It may
not even support the use of externally provided hints. In any case,
there's no standard (that I know of) way to get this hint into a
receiver - AGPS inside a phone doesn't count - so we can't just build
in a hook to do it.

FWIW, when you do have good assistance data, and your receiver can use
it, then you win. My GPS18 can take a significant amount of time to
get lock after a cold start, as can my antaris 4t - &quot;significant&quot; =
hours. I don't have really great visibility.

I ran the site survey on the antaris, and I have high confidence in
the position of the phase center of the antenna on my distribution
system. Now I can feed that into my receivers as an initial position
using a couple of hackish little tools to just send a message to a raw
device (haven't tried hacking that to use the control socket yet). Due
to atmospheric effects, the receiver might calculate an instantaneous
position up to 10m away, but it'll start kicking out valid solutions
within a few minutes, rather than hours.

GDB has a 'break' feature; why doesn't it have 'fix' too?
