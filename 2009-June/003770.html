<PRE>Hello all!

Quick version: I think I found two bugs in driver_tsip.c; patch is below.

Long version:

I am trying to use gpsctl with a Trimble &quot;Resolution T&quot;, a GPS module
optimized for timing applications.  I have a dev kit that gives me the
module with a USB-to-serial converter.  I have looked at the output in
Minicom and verified that it is sending TSIP binary packets.

The gpsctl shipped in 2.39 can't detect that this is a Trimble; 'gpsctl
-f /dev/ttyUSB0' gives 'gpsctl: packet recognition timed out'.  Turning
up the debug level shows that it gets as far as deciding it's TSIP,
switching to 8O1 (which is what TSIP wants), and then listening for some
packets; the last thing it tries before dying is sending a packet:

---
gpsctl: Not a Garmin packet
gpsctl: TSIP pkt_id = 0x8f, packetlen= 21
gpsctl: Packet type 4 accepted 21 = 108fab00000008040000000c080000160807cf1003
gpsctl: Packet discard of 21, chars remaining is 1 = 10
gpsctl: Sent TSIP packet id 0x1f: 
[pauses a few seconds here]
gpsctl: packet recognition timed out.
---

I looked in driver_tsip.c and found what I think is bug #1: in
tsip_write(), ep is first set with reference to the buffer that is about
to be sent, but then a length is calculated using ep and the buffer that
was passed in by the caller.  This resulted in the call to gpsd_write()
asking for more than 1 million bytes to be written.  I changed the
length computation and gpsctl works better; with the same invocation it
comes back with '/dev/ttyUSB0 identified as a Trimble TSIP at 9600'.

I then tried to use gpsctl for what I really wanted, which was to send
the TSIP packet that flipped the output to NMEA mode.  But gpsctl
reported that sending the command packet failed.  Poking at it some more,
I found that tsip_write() compares the return value of gpsd_write() with
a length len that was passed in by the caller - but len has been
*modified* before this comparison is made!  I changed it to compare
against the same length value that was passed to gpsd_write() and it
worked better; gpsctl could successfully flip the GPS to NMEA mode.

Here is a patch that fixes both of these bugs.  It is in diff -u and I
ran the regression tests and splint against it.  The driver_tsip.c
shipped with 2.39 is identical to the latest svn version, so the patch
should apply to either.

I hope this helps!
