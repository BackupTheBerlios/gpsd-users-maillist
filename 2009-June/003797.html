&gt;<i> At the bottom of page 3, you see a portable with its ps/2 to usb cable...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I maybe need such a cable, but I have such one (for keyboard + mouse,
</I>&gt;<i> where I can switch kb and mouse...)
</I>
you are assuming that the pinnout would be the same. There's a good chance
that it isn't. PS/2 is just the shape of the connector, not how it is
wired up or what protocol it uses. A small round connector is nice if you
need to drill just big enough O.D. holes through walls to pass the wire
through.

e.g. the PS/2 pinnout listed here (for another GPS) has the following in
big red letters next to the diagram:

<A HREF="http://www.semsons.com/glmrbuwagpsp.html">http://www.semsons.com/glmrbuwagpsp.html</A>

&quot;MR-350P uses a propriatary pin-out on the PS2, which cannot be connected
directly to any laptop or PC without the use of a cable set (USB or RS232
+ PS2 for power)&quot;

You you knew the wiring for your model and were up for that sort of
challenge there is a good chance you could solder up the cable yourself.

As it is I expect it is not talking because the transmit/receive lines
are not in the correct holes.


&gt;<i> PS/ important to say: I bought this on Ebay, and the plastic case of the
</I>&gt;<i> antenna had 4 cracks in it when it arrived...
</I>
At this point I'd be returning the thing as defective and rating the
vendor as appropriate.

If it is missing functional parts or not (USB/serial adapter cable) as
well would depend in the manner in which it was advertised or represented.


good luck,
Hamish
