<PRE>Hiya,

&gt;<i>I maybe need such a cable, but I have such one (for keyboard + 
</I>&gt;<i>mouse, where I can switch kb and mouse...)
</I>
I think you've missed my point - at the top of page 3 in the document 
I referenced there is the pin-out of the PS2 connector used by this 
GPS. It clearly shows that the GPS is outputting RS232 data, as well 
as requiring power. Absolutely nothing to do with the PS2 keyboard &amp; 
mouse connections on the back of a PC (or in a USB to keyboard adapter).

In fact, the only similarity between the keyboard PS2 connector and 
the PS2 connector that Haicom have used is that they both use the 
same six-pin mini DIN connector. You WILL NOT be able to plug this 
GPS into any sort of PS2 shaped keyboard or mouse port.

You're going to have to either make or buy the appropriate 
translation cable. The GPS to USB cable will have to have some form 
of RS232 to USB chip (i.e. FTDI, Prolific) to do in interfacing; the 
GPS to RS232 DB9 connector MAY not.

&gt;<i>I maybe need such a cable, but I have such one (for keyboard + 
</I>&gt;<i>mouse, where I can switch kb and mouse...)
</I>
Just to re-iterate - your USB to keyboard &amp; mouse cable IS NOT going 
to work - in any way, shape or form, no matter what driver you load 
into the Linux kernel.

ciao, Dave
