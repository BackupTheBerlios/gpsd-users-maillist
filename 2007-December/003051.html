</I>
This is a good question. I have a BU-353 and when using it indoors (our
building is built a bit like Windsor castle) I often see the fix bounce
out by ~100m. We have a solid wall just across from the office window
and a 10 story building across the street. In the field, given a clear
view of the sky the position is stable within 2-5m. I have always
assumed the 100m errors were because of multipath reflections and the
GPS's ability to lock onto those very weak signals. Interestingly, the
100m errors all happen along a very clear bearing from the fixed GPS
antenna.

&gt;<i> &gt; My questions:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Is this level of accuracy typical cheap GPS receivers in general,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; or is this one just a turkey?
</I>
If it happens in an urban jungle, count it as reflections causing
delays in the signal arrival times of obscured sats. If it happens with
a clear sky to the horizon, it's a goose.


&gt;<i> &quot;Poor man's DGPS&quot;. no. for you to have a hope of having that work,
</I>&gt;<i> you need to have the clocks in your receivers be synchronized, and
</I>&gt;<i> you need to have a way to ensure that they're both making 
</I>&gt;<i> observations at the same time.
</I>
And a way to ensure that they are tracking the same birds as they go
above and below the horizon or other barriers.

To do it properly, you need 2 GPSs which output per satellite pseudo-
ranges, and keep one at a surveyed position. Calculate corrections for
base station GPS vs. surveyed position, and (post-processing) apply
corrections to the roving GPS record. Add a real-time VHF link to the
roving GPS with the corrections and you've reinvented DGPS.


&gt;<i> &gt; My intended application involves some (very rough) GIS stuff for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; educational purposes on a very limited budget,
</I>
may I suggest some free solutions then:
GRASS GIS (load GPS data with v.in.gpsbabel or v.in.ascii modules)
  <A HREF="http://grass.ibiblio.org">http://grass.ibiblio.org</A>
QuantumGIS (GPS Plugin [also using gpsbabel])
  <A HREF="http://www.qgis.org">http://www.qgis.org</A>
GPSdrive  (live gpsd using navigation software)
  http//www.gpsdrive.de


&gt;<i> &gt; and my past experience with (much higher end) GPS survey gear
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; suggested that I could get accuracy to within 2-3 meters and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; consistency to about a meter (within a few-hour daylight time
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; window), which is &quot;good enough&quot;.
</I>
You should be able to get that with most mainstream GPSs, as with CD
players, you (mostly) get the same stream of digital output from a $50
or $2000 player. The big difference comes in things like error handling
or hard core precision....
