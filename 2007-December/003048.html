<PRE>I recently bought a GlobalSat BU-353, plugged it in, fired up gpsd, and magic 
happened. Then I started looking at the numbers coming out and realized that 
with (usually) 7 or 8 satellites in view, I was getting drifts (overnight) of 
over 100M vertically and a horizontal drift of a couple blocks horizontally 
(according to Google Maps' geocoding, anyway). I looked at the NMEA, and 
realized this is a receiver problem and gpsd is working properly, but I'm 
trying to figure out if I should RMA it before I leave town on Monday, and 
figured there were other BU-353 users here.


My questions:
Is this level of accuracy typical cheap GPS receivers in general, or is this 
one just a turkey?

Also... If I get a second one, will it read the same as the first one, so I can 
keep one stationary for a differential offset? My intended application involves 
some (very rough) GIS stuff for educational purposes on a very limited budget, 
and my past experience with (much higher end) GPS survey gear suggested that I 
could get accuracy to within 2-3 meters and consistency to about a meter 
(within a few-hour daylight time window), which is &quot;good enough&quot;. (A randomly 
varying error of up to almost a kilometer is definately not.)
