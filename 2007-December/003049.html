ex-BU353 user. the usb-serial chip on mine stopped working, so i'm
going to try hack it to just do regular serial.

i had a BU-303 on top of an office building for the last couple of
years, and on a bad day, i'd have an HDOP of 1.4 - usually it was
0.8-1.0, but sometimes it would go as low as 0.6. I had great
observation conditions. Even then, I'd see +/-15m vertical drifts, but
only +/-2m horizontal drift. My 353 was pretty similar, though
globalsat sold me one that didn't do WAAS, and then either refused to
upgrade the firmware or wanted to charge me stupid amounts of money to
do so.

Do you have good skyview? Any tall buildings either obstructing parts
of the sky or possibly causing reflections?

&gt;<i> My questions:
</I>&gt;<i> Is this level of accuracy typical cheap GPS receivers in general, or is this
</I>&gt;<i> one just a turkey?
</I>
Turkey, or a bad time of day. See comment above. A typical &quot;cheap&quot; gps
with WAAS and  should easily be able to do better than 5m. Heck, my
old garmin etrex (ca. 1999) could do 3m on a good day.

&gt;<i> Also... If I get a second one, will it read the same as the first one, so I can
</I>&gt;<i> keep one stationary for a differential offset?
</I>
&quot;Poor man's DGPS&quot;. no. for you to have a hope of having that work, you
need to have the clocks in your receivers be synchronized, and you
need to have a way to ensure that they're both making observations at
the same time.

&gt;<i> My intended application involves
</I>&gt;<i> some (very rough) GIS stuff for educational purposes on a very limited budget,
</I>&gt;<i> and my past experience with (much higher end) GPS survey gear suggested that I
</I>&gt;<i> could get accuracy to within 2-3 meters and consistency to about a meter
</I>&gt;<i> (within a few-hour daylight time window), which is &quot;good enough&quot;. (A randomly
</I>&gt;<i> varying error of up to almost a kilometer is definately not.)
</I>
you can get a ublox antaris4T eval kit for ~$350. I got a thales ac12
board for $150. I got an iTrax03-based usb/bluetooth/datalogger for
$120. NovAtel SuperStarII are about $165 new (are you listening, Santa
Claus?). All of these are considered to be decent entry level
receivers for mucking about w/ carrier phase applications. see

see <A HREF="http://www.precision-gps.org/Hardware.htm">http://www.precision-gps.org/Hardware.htm</A> for more opinions.

Also, have a look at Trimble's planning software to figure out when
your best observation window is...

GDB has a 'break' feature; why doesn't it have 'fix' too?
