something like that. point gpsd at a file full of raw gps capture, and
out comes gpsd-format messages. at least two of us have our uses for
this.

&gt;<i> 4. new driver: ashtech -- Support for the Ashtech chips often used
</I>&gt;<i> in embedded navigation systems.
</I>
and there's a patch to do this in the debian tracker. should probably
follow up w/ the submitter and mention that gpsd is bsd-licensed and
check that they're ok with that before merging the patch.

&gt;<i> 5. new output format for hi-rez postprocessing -- not certain what this
</I>&gt;<i> is about but it might mesh with our to-to item of tweaking the output
</I>&gt;<i> formats so they can play nice with millimeter-precision GPSes.
</I>
part of it is not throwing away inbound precision data. the other part
of it is contingent on the next generation protocol: i want to add raw
measurement output in some common format so that toolkits like gpstk
and gipsy can be used.

&gt;<i> 6. fix the Trimble support -- something is badly wrong in the TSIP/Trimble
</I>&gt;<i> drivers.  Their regression tests are so unstable that I've taken them
</I>&gt;<i> out of the qualification sequence for release and added a warning to the
</I>&gt;<i> bug list in TODO.  This should be fixed; Chris muttered about doing it
</I>&gt;<i> during an upcoming trip to Mexico.
</I>
why mexico? because i can actually sit outside with my laptop and work
on it. gps hacking in a wintery urban canyon is no fun.

GDB has a 'break' feature; why doesn't it have 'fix' too?
