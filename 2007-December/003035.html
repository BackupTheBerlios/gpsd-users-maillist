The Globalsat receiver appears to be a CompactFlash card; is this
correct?

Sounds reasonable.  One of the modes of many CompactFlash (CF) cards
is a &quot;PCMCIA&quot; mode; the commonly available adapters (that look like a
PCMCIA card with a notch out of the end) that let you put a CF card
   in a PCMCIA slot are just two connectors and some wires - there is no
active circuitry in the adapter.  The PCMCIA interfacing is handled
inside the CF card.

&gt;<i> So now I am trying to get gpsd to see this device as a USB device on a
</I>&gt;<i> different machine using a SanDisk 12-in-1 reader.
</I>
Trying to do this through a card reader may be the problem.  I am not an
expert, but I'm pretty sure that CF cards can present different interfaces
to the outside world depending on how they are accessed.  One of them is
PCMCIA, as above, and another is IDE, like a hard drive.

The PCMCIA bus is (to a rough approximation, I think) an ISA or PCI bus
with a funny-shaped connector.  What this means is that you can plug the
same kinds of things into a PCMCIA slot as you would plug into an ISA or
PCI slot and have them work.  In your case, the CF card starts &quot;speaking&quot;
PCMCIA, and the CPU &quot;sees&quot; it as a normal expansion card.  The details
get passed along to the Linux kernel, which says &quot;Serial port!  I know
about those.&quot; and creates the /dev/ttySomething device.

IDE is... well, IDE.  It is optimized for transferring data between two
devices (normally a hard drive and the motherboard), but doesn't have as
much in the way of interrupts, addressing, etc.  CF cards also support
this mode; in this case the CF card is basically a slow-ish hard drive
with a funny connector.  When you plug the CF GPS into the card reader,
the CF GPS is either doing a) nothing or b) &quot;speaking&quot; IDE, and the CPU
&quot;sees&quot; it as a normal hard drive or flash card (like you would use in a
digital camera).  This gets passed along to the Linux kernel, which says
&quot;Hard disk!  I know about those.&quot; and creates something like /dev/hda or
/dev/sdb .

One way to tell if this is happening is to look at the kernel messages
with the dmesg command.  You might say dmesg first, before doing
anything, so you know what messages were already there (dmesg output is
typically not timestamped).  Then, plug the GPS card in, wait a few
seconds, and say dmesg again.  If you see messages along the lines of
&quot;attached SCSI disk sdb&quot;, then the kernel is seeing the GPS as a flash
card instead of as a serial device.

If you don't see anything in dmesg - or something like an &quot;unknown
device&quot; error - then the chances are fair that the CF GPS is simply
refusing to speak IDE.  The card reader knows that *something* has been
plugged in, but the GPS is just sulking in the corner.

What you *probably* need is a USB-to-PCMCIA adapter.  These do exist,
but are not as common or as cheap (maybe US$70) as USB memory card
readers.  Places that sell the newer wireless-Internet-over-cell-phone
PCMCIA cards tend to stock them.  I have little experience with these,
but reading Web sites gives me the impression that they vary somewhat in
quality and device support; if you buy one, you might see if you can try
it at a local store first, or look for an online vendor with a decent
return/exchange policy.

I hope this helps!
