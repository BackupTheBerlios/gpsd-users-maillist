Awesome. Someone who knows the hardware. :)

It's a residential (single-family home) neighborhood, there are trees 
(currently leafless, though), no aluminum/steel siding. OK view of the sky 
above, and to the southwest. At some point (when I have a laptop 
available), I'll take it somewhere where it'll have a full sky view, and 
see if that settles it down (but it's not sounding good).

I rubber-banded the receiver to a board and stuck it out the window. It 
seems to have limited the vertical drift to a 30M range, and the 
horizontal drift has settled down to the last two digits of the lat + lon 
seconds.

There's still a (fairly constant) 2 block offset west-northwest. 
This is based on using Google Maps, though, and I have no idea what 
projection they're using. Offsets are fine for my application, as long
as they're consistant.

&gt;<i> you can get a ublox antaris4T eval kit for ~$350. I got a thales ac12

Thanks for the feedback. My (personal, and thus funds-limited) project 
involves using (cheap!) GPS modules on OLPC hardware, and I was hoping 
it'd be good enough to generate elevation models with (plausible, if 
not exact) 10M contour lines. Sounds like SiRF doesn't have the 
resolution, and anything with the resolution starts running into 
budgetary constraints.
