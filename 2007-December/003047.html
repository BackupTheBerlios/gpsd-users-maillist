<PRE>Claus,

   thanks for taking the time to test the application.

   That's encouraging.  I tested successfully with the libgps.so from 2.36.

&gt;<i> 1. no-jitter - clicked the option but not sure what to look for. But 
</I>&gt;<i> the &quot;Speed&quot; and &quot;Bearing&quot; fields are not blanked between updates.
</I>
   Yep, I think that's it.  One can see the effect when using at least
some receivers in NMEA mode, where between updates some of the fields
keep getting blanked as you describe--receivers which give an atomic PVT
report will not show any difference.  In terms of user interface, the
user knows whether no-jitter is on or off by looking at the toggle
status of the relevant menu option, and obviously, by receiving a
satisfactory display without &quot;blinking&quot; fields (the only exception to
this would be if moving at a steady slow speed--the client has a min.
speed threshold below which the GPS unit will appear as stationary.)

   For reference, what the no-jitter option does is send a &quot;j1&quot; command
to the daemon, either when clicked on, or when first connecting if it
was already on. Conversely, it sends &quot;j0&quot; when clicked off.

   Note that if you are streaming raw data (Raw Data -&gt; Format -&gt; GPSD)
the no-jitter option has no effect on it.  This is by design, but not
sure whether I made the correct decision--comments one way or the other
are welcome (btw, it works that way because the raw data stream is in
reality a completely independent connection to the gpsd server).

&gt;<i> 2. copy position as text and KML. Both work. Nice. (Paste &quot;Copy Position&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> directly into the input field of Google Maps. Save &quot;Copy as KML&quot; to 
</I>&gt;<i> somefile.KML and open in Google Earth)
</I>
   Good to know it works.  When using &quot;Copy As KML&quot;, you should be able
to paste the selection directly rather than save to a file (although
that is certainly an option).  Try for example, selecting the &quot;Temporary
Places&quot; folder in the GEarth side pane, then press Ctrl+V (or Paste from
either the context or the edit menu).

&gt;<i> 3. gps data source as commandline argument. both work. <A HREF="gpsd://gpsd.rellim.com">gpsd://gpsd.rellim.com</A> 
</I>&gt;<i> is from Bend, OR. qtgpsc /dev/rfcomm0 works but the &quot;Device&quot; dropdown list 
</I>&gt;<i> lists 2 (identical) &quot;dev/rfcomm0&quot; entries.
</I>
   Aha.  Thanks for that.  I couldn't run a gpsd locally last night so
was unable to test, and by reading the code I made the mistaken
assumption that upon connecting it would clear the device list before
repopulating.  I'll fix that.

   Another thing I haven't been able to test is whether the device combo
actually works when more than one gps is attached to the daemon.  If
anyone finds it doesn't please drop me a line.

   Cheers for the link to the Mapper thingy btw, I'll have a play with it.

Regards,
Diego Berge.
