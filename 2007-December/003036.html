<PRE>Hiya,

I've fought with a couple of different Sandisk readers and Linux over the 
past couple of years. One trick I found was to insert the CF card into the 
card reader BEFORE plugging the USB port into the PC.

I found that if you don't do this, the kernel doesn't seem to get a hotplug 
event when the CF card is plugged in for the first time and therefore 
doesn't try to enumerate the CF card. If you plug the CF card in before 
plugging the USB, the kernel will get both the USB hotplug event, and the 
CF card insertion event and you will get sdb (or similar). After this point 
you can mount/unmount and remove/insert cards to your heart's content.

However, my experience and understanding of the PCMCIA/CARDBUS (yes, they 
are different protocols, although they fit in the same slots) agrees with 
Matt, and I also believe that you are probably hosed without getting a 
PCMCIA to USB adapter.

ciao, Dave

</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Sounds reasonable.  One of the modes of many CompactFlash (CF) cards
</I>&gt;<i>is a &quot;PCMCIA&quot; mode; the commonly available adapters (that look like a
</I>&gt;<i>PCMCIA card with a notch out of the end) that let you put a CF card
</I>&gt;<i>    in a PCMCIA slot are just two connectors and some wires - there is no
</I>&gt;<i>active circuitry in the adapter.  The PCMCIA interfacing is handled
</I>&gt;<i>inside the CF card.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So now I am trying to get gpsd to see this device as a USB device on a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; different machine using a SanDisk 12-in-1 reader.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Trying to do this through a card reader may be the problem.  I am not an
</I>&gt;<i>expert, but I'm pretty sure that CF cards can present different interfaces
</I>&gt;<i>to the outside world depending on how they are accessed.  One of them is
</I>&gt;<i>PCMCIA, as above, and another is IDE, like a hard drive.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>The PCMCIA bus is (to a rough approximation, I think) an ISA or PCI bus
</I>&gt;<i>with a funny-shaped connector.  What this means is that you can plug the
</I>&gt;<i>same kinds of things into a PCMCIA slot as you would plug into an ISA or
</I>&gt;<i>PCI slot and have them work.  In your case, the CF card starts &quot;speaking&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>PCMCIA, and the CPU &quot;sees&quot; it as a normal expansion card.  The details
</I>&gt;<i>get passed along to the Linux kernel, which says &quot;Serial port!  I know
</I>&gt;<i>about those.&quot; and creates the /dev/ttySomething device.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>IDE is... well, IDE.  It is optimized for transferring data between two
</I>&gt;<i>devices (normally a hard drive and the motherboard), but doesn't have as
</I>&gt;<i>much in the way of interrupts, addressing, etc.  CF cards also support
</I>&gt;<i>this mode; in this case the CF card is basically a slow-ish hard drive
</I>&gt;<i>with a funny connector.  When you plug the CF GPS into the card reader,
</I>&gt;<i>the CF GPS is either doing a) nothing or b) &quot;speaking&quot; IDE, and the CPU
</I>&gt;<i>&quot;sees&quot; it as a normal hard drive or flash card (like you would use in a
</I>&gt;<i>digital camera).  This gets passed along to the Linux kernel, which says
</I>&gt;<i>&quot;Hard disk!  I know about those.&quot; and creates something like /dev/hda or
</I>&gt;<i>/dev/sdb .
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>One way to tell if this is happening is to look at the kernel messages
</I>&gt;<i>with the dmesg command.  You might say dmesg first, before doing
</I>&gt;<i>anything, so you know what messages were already there (dmesg output is
</I>&gt;<i>typically not timestamped).  Then, plug the GPS card in, wait a few
</I>&gt;<i>seconds, and say dmesg again.  If you see messages along the lines of
</I>&gt;<i>&quot;attached SCSI disk sdb&quot;, then the kernel is seeing the GPS as a flash
</I>&gt;<i>card instead of as a serial device.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>If you don't see anything in dmesg - or something like an &quot;unknown
</I>&gt;<i>device&quot; error - then the chances are fair that the CF GPS is simply
</I>&gt;<i>refusing to speak IDE.  The card reader knows that *something* has been
</I>&gt;<i>plugged in, but the GPS is just sulking in the corner.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>What you *probably* need is a USB-to-PCMCIA adapter.  These do exist,
</I>&gt;<i>but are not as common or as cheap (maybe US$70) as USB memory card
</I>&gt;<i>readers.  Places that sell the newer wireless-Internet-over-cell-phone
</I>&gt;<i>PCMCIA cards tend to stock them.  I have little experience with these,
</I>&gt;<i>but reading Web sites gives me the impression that they vary somewhat in
</I>&gt;<i>quality and device support; if you buy one, you might see if you can try
</I>&gt;<i>it at a local store first, or look for an online vendor with a decent
</I>&gt;<i>return/exchange policy.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I hope this helps!
