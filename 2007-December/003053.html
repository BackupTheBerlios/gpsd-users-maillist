Try that Trimble planning app - You could be in a place/time where
your reception sucks.

Random antennas, satellite dishes, power lines and other metallic
objects can also impact GPS reception.

So can temperature. My BU-303 was rated down to -20C; colder than that
and it would report weaker signals and larger errors, probably due to
the onboard clock slowing and the patch antenna shrinking. I never
noticed much of a problem with precipitation - rain, snow or ice.

Something else you can try: let your receiver drive gpsd for 24hrs,
and log the output with &quot;gpspipe -rv &gt; mysite.txt&quot;. It'll be big. Then
feed the log to the skyview.php script included with the gpsd
distribution. You'll get some neat graphs like this - they might
explain what you're seeing.

&gt;<i> I rubber-banded the receiver to a board and stuck it out the window. It
</I>&gt;<i> seems to have limited the vertical drift to a 30M range, and the
</I>&gt;<i> horizontal drift has settled down to the last two digits of the lat + lon
</I>&gt;<i> seconds.
</I>
Vertical resolution is always harder to get than horizontal.

&gt;<i> There's still a (fairly constant) 2 block offset west-northwest.
</I>&gt;<i> This is based on using Google Maps, though, and I have no idea what
</I>&gt;<i> projection they're using. Offsets are fine for my application, as long
</I>&gt;<i> as they're consistant.
</I>
Wanna bet someone is interpreting the location format wrong? ie.
DDD.MMSSss vs DDD.dddddd? That's been the cause of a few
off-by-2-blocks errors in the past.

&gt;<i> Thanks for the feedback. My (personal, and thus funds-limited) project
</I>&gt;<i> involves using (cheap!) GPS modules on OLPC hardware, and I was hoping
</I>&gt;<i> it'd be good enough to generate elevation models with (plausible, if
</I>&gt;<i> not exact) 10M contour lines. Sounds like SiRF doesn't have the
</I>&gt;<i> resolution, and anything with the resolution starts running into
</I>&gt;<i> budgetary constraints.
</I>
I can understand the desire to go cheap, but I keep finding new
receivers to hack on. Maybe get a UT-41; they're $35 or so.

Like Matt Roberds says, trade money for time. If you're willing to
sample a given location for a few minutes to an hour at a time, you
can get a pretty good idea of where you are, with high confidence.

GDB has a 'break' feature; why doesn't it have 'fix' too?
