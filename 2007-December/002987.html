<PRE>We made really solid progress in 2.35.  The news that makes me
happiest is that our regression-test infrastructure is now sound. The
32-vs-64-bit problems in the tests have been traced to some subtle
bugs in floating-point handling and fixed.  A longstanding algorithmic
error that was producing bad altitude-error estimates has been
rectified.  And the technical problems with the Python test monitor
code that made Chris unable to use it have been solved.

We've already had our first significant post-2.35 feature; Petr Slansky sent
me a driver for Garmin Simple Text Protocol which I have merged.

In IRC discussion, Chris Kuethe and I have identified the following
near- and medium-term goals for gpsd:

Chris (who should correct me if I have any of this wrong):

1. pipe mode -- I think this is Chris's proposal for a revived -T option
or something similar.

2. new command language -- Implementation of the NG command syntax
we've been kicking around, including things like the ability to set
listener address lists.

3. new driver: oncore -- I'm guessing this would be support for the 
Motorola Oncore GPSes.

4. new driver: ashtech -- Support for the Ashtech chips often used
in embedded navigation systems.

5. new output format for hi-rez postprocessing -- not certain what this
is about but it might mesh with our to-to item of tweaking the output
formats so they can play nice with millimeter-precision GPSes.

6. fix the Trimble support -- something is badly wrong in the TSIP/Trimble
drivers.  Their regression tests are so unstable that I've taken them
out of the qualification sequence for release and added a warning to the
bug list in TODO.  This should be fixed; Chris muttered about doing it
during an upcoming trip to Mexico.

Eric:

1. Merge in Qt and GTK test clients from Diego Berge and Bill Marr.  (Bill,
if you're out there, I don't have a pointer to source for your code.)

2. Various small fixes on the Motif client.  I want to frame the message-data
window properly.  It should do automatic retries at connecting with the server
after it has registered offline for a while.  I'd like to have a 'View' 
menu pulldown with checkboxes that can be used to suppress the 
skyview/message-data/GPS-data frames.

3, After both 1 and 2 are done, we must do a functional and esthetic 
evaluation and decide whether or not the Motif client is worth keeping.
(It's a maintenance pain in the ass.)

4. New command language -- I want to write it because I like writing
such things, but I also think it's good strategy to hold off doing it 
as long as possible.

5, GPS simulator -- I've written the first proof-of-concept Python code
for a tool to generate NMEA tracks from course-speed-waypoint descriptions.
There is a lot more work to be done here.

6. Move us to Mercurial or some other 3G version-control system.  Subversion
has served us well but the newer ones have big advantages, including 
disconnected operation and better merge algorithms.

Obviously a lot of these are longer-term goals.  I think I'd like to plan
for a 2.36 in the relatively short term, maybe as little as three weeks
to a month out.  We should aim for these things:

* Oncore support, Ashtech support, fixed Trimble drivers.

* As much work as we can get done on the Motif, Qt, and GTK clients
  while those drivers are being coded and qualified.

I'd add Chris's pipe mode, but it is going to be hard to sell to me now that
we've solved the technical problems with gpsfake and it can reliably
do what gpsd -T would do.  I'm sure we'll have a good wrangle about this. :-)
