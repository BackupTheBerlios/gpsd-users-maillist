Sounds like my situation.  I have an older GPS with a Rockwell Jupiter
chipset.  Putting it on the window sill is a crap shoot.  Hanging it a
few inches out of the window improves matters; having it out on the lawn
is a bigger win.

&gt;<i> At some point (when I have a laptop available), I'll take it somewhere

The USB specification limits cables to a certain length, but if you look
around, you can buy longer ones.  Or, hack up an existing cable.  This
way you can stick the GPS further out in the yard.  You will probably be
disappointed trying to use a USB 2 external hard drive on the far end of
a 30 foot (10 m) USB cable, but for a GPS, the chances are fair that it
will work just fine.  Turn the serial rate down as low as you can stand
for slightly better results.

&gt;<i> There's still a (fairly constant) 2 block offset west-northwest.

The best way I have found to figure out if your GPS is lying to you is
to consult a USGS topgraphic map, or a commercial map that is based on
that data (like the Delorme &quot;Atlas and Gazetteer&quot; series).  Bust out
your ruler and interpolate the co-ordinates of your house (tip: you'll
go less insane by using millimeters as opposed to inches) to get a pretty
good idea of where you should be.  Most larger public libraries have the
USGS topographic maps for the local area; often you can't check them out,
but you can ogle them at the library as much as you want.

&gt;<i> Thanks for the feedback. My (personal, and thus funds-limited) project

</I>&gt;<i> it'd be good enough to generate elevation models with (plausible, if
</I>&gt;<i> not exact) 10M contour lines.
</I>
You can always trade time for money.  To a zeroth approximation, the
longer you leave the GPS receiver parked at a certain spot, the better
you can tell where it is.  Yes, the reported position will wander
around, but if you leave it there long enough, you usually will be able
to see the positions clustering around a center.
