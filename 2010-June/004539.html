I am not seeing gpsd running wild in my testing. Are you using the
latest version (git HEAD)? 2.39 and some of the 2.9x versions have a
bug, which has since been handled. I see it in the debian gpsd
2.90.1~svn6819-1 package. gpsd goes hog wild after I unplug the
receiver.

If the GPS is deactivated (which is what the code I showed you
detects), you need only send a &quot;watch&quot;. This alerts the daemon to send
you an update when it sees the receiver again.

In a bit of testing, I just added a call to sendWatch () right after
the code that sets up the &quot;GPS Found&quot; message for display, and that
helps. So I begin to suspect that you have to call sendWatch () every
time you get a DEVICE_SET message. If not, it's a harmless bit of
overhead.

But if you want to close down the socket and re-open it, you can do
that, and it also works. I think it's overkill, though.

I have been assuming that you should only look at gps_data from your
callback. Any other time it could be modified out from under you. If
you need data from it elsewhere, stuff the data you need into a separate
buffer you control.
