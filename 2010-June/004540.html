</I>The gpsd output in my original message suggests 2.92 (Ubuntu 10.04).

Just to be clear, gpsd is not going hogwild.  It just closes the connection
to the client after a minute when no GPS is plugged in.  This causes my
callback in the client to get called in a tight loop, and it is the first
time my callback is called.  Once the socket is closed by the server, I
think all the client can do is shut it down and re-open it, right?  It does
seem extreme, but I'm not sure what the other options are.

I guess the fundamental question is, is gpsd supposed to be closing the
socket after 1 minute?  And if so, what's the appropriate way to handle it?
I'm not sure I understand your comments about DEVICE_SET messages and
sendWatch(), because there is no connection to gpsd to send it over once my
callback is called for the first time.

Hope this clarifies the problem some. Thanks again for your attention to
this, Charles.
