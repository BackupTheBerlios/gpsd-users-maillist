<PRE>Jason von Nieda &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-users">jason at vonnieda.org</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> Hi all. I posted a while back about my Trimble Lassen iQ reporting speed
</I>&gt;<i> and mode incorrectly in TSIP mode. I ended up coming up with a patch to
</I>&gt;<i> fix both problems but never got around to submitting it. So, here it is.
</I>&gt;<i> If it can't make it in that's fine, or if it's just something that Rob
</I>&gt;<i> wants to take a look at that's cool too. I've been using this patched
</I>&gt;<i> gpsd in my car for about 2 months and it seems solid.
</I>
Two months of testing is enough for me.
 
&gt;<i> The two problems I was having were that speed was being reported in m/s
</I>&gt;<i> instead of knots and that the status and mode were inaccurate. gpsd
</I>&gt;<i> would often report that I had a 3D fix but the data coming in would be
</I>&gt;<i> all zeros.
</I>
That sounds familiar.  I think you just axed one of the outstanding bug 
entries.

&gt;<i> I haven't submitted many patches to many projects, so if I've done this
</I>&gt;<i> all wrong I apologize in advance :)
</I>
Looks pretty clean, actually, except that I see no reason for you to have 
commented out the gpsd_report() function.  I backed out that part.
