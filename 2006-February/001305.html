<PRE>Hi all. I posted a while back about my Trimble Lassen iQ reporting speed
and mode incorrectly in TSIP mode. I ended up coming up with a patch to
fix both problems but never got around to submitting it. So, here it is.
If it can't make it in that's fine, or if it's just something that Rob
wants to take a look at that's cool too. I've been using this patched
gpsd in my car for about 2 months and it seems solid.

The two problems I was having were that speed was being reported in m/s
instead of knots and that the status and mode were inaccurate. gpsd
would often report that I had a 3D fix but the data coming in would be
all zeros.

I haven't submitted many patches to many projects, so if I've done this
all wrong I apologize in advance :)

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ** Bugs gpsd tickles in other software
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *** A long-running xgps may induce a memory leak in the X server
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Rob Janssen writes, reporting from SuSE 9.2 + Xorg 6.8.1 + KDE 3.3:
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I have found something that leaks.  Not in our software, but in the X server.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> But caused by xgps.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> After 3 copies of xgps ran for a couple of days, I noticed a lot of swap
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is in use:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Mem:       1035776     992324      43452          0     174580      54756
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> -/+ buffers/cache:     762988     272788
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Swap:      2104440    1444944     659496
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This is more than normal for my system.  I noticed it when switching to a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> virtual screen where mozilla is running.  It took several seconds to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> redraw.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I did a &quot;ps axu&quot; and found these interesting lines:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> USER       PID %CPU %MEM   VSZ  RSS TTY      STAT START   TIME COMMAND
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> root      7004  2.5 33.6 1861128 348460 ?    SL   Jun19 210:46 /usr/X11R6/bi
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ntp      18011  0.0  0.2  2696 2692 ?        SLs  Jun19   0:00 /usr/sbin/ntp
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> nobody   23105  0.0  0.0  7004  900 ?        S&lt;sl Jun21   0:17 /home/rob/src
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> rob      28724  0.2  0.1  7084 1968 pts/18   S    Jun22   9:03 /home/rob/src
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> rob      28744  0.3  0.1  7084 2040 pts/18   S    Jun22  14:52 /home/rob/src
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> rob      28759  0.2  0.1  7084 1936 pts/18   S    Jun22   9:44 /home/rob/src
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So the gps programs were not consuming that much memory.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I still stopped the 3 xgps programs (the last three in this list) and then
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the X server showed:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> root      7004  2.5  2.2 367140 23424 ?      SL   Jun19 210:49 /usr/X11R6/bi
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So there certainly is a relation here.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Unfortunately I have zero knowledge about X programming.  I would guess
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> some kind of session or operation is started and never ended, or something
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is said to be saved, but apparently it remains related to the specific
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> window because the X server neatly frees it once the program disconnects.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But Rob's xgps memory leak doesn't reproduce on a stock Fedora Core 3
</I>&gt;<i> system.  ESR tested for this in the simplest possible way, by doing
</I>&gt;<i> system(&quot;free t&quot;) at the end of each handle_input() call.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ** To do:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *** SiRF firmware uploader
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Chris Kuethe has shipped a 0.0 alpha version.  It is not yet 
</I>&gt;<i> resolved whether SiRF Technology will allow us to ship the 
</I>&gt;<i> binary loader code needed to actually use it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *** RINEX-format dumping of raw satellite data
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It would be useful to be able to extract RINEX-format data from any
</I>&gt;<i> GPS device that can report pseudoranges etc.  This belongs in the
</I>&gt;<i> daemon because the device drivers are already doing the
</I>&gt;<i> packet-cracking needed to get the data off the chips.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *** RTCM support.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We have an RTCM packet decoder, and untested scratch code to serve
</I>&gt;<i> RTCM packets to port 2101.  Here's the plan for the rest of it:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1) Inversion needs to be done somewhere in the encoding logic.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2) Wolfgang's decoder-hardening patches.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3) Test productions.  I have one that tests dumping and one that uses   
</I>&gt;<i>    passthrough mode to test that pack() and repack() are inverse.  We
</I>&gt;<i>    should have an undumping torture test.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 4) What about rtcm_output_mag() anyway?  Should that be made
</I>&gt;<i>    available as an output mode of rtcmdecode and documented?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 5) Python libraries must grok RTCM dump format.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 6) Extend the test framework so we can verify RTCM service.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 7) Get rid of the -d option by hacking open_device() so that when it
</I>&gt;<i>    sees a command-line option of the form server:port (with no
</I>&gt;<i>    embedded backslashes) it opens a socket to read from that server.
</I>&gt;<i>    Now any GPS-packet and RTCM data sources given on the command line
</I>&gt;<i>    can be remote as well as local.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 8) Generate and broadcast RTCM corrections from an attached device?
</I>&gt;<i>    Might not be possible -- appears to need nanosecond timing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *** Do the research to figure out just what is going on with status bits
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> NMEA actually has *four* kinds of validity bits: Mode, Status, the
</I>&gt;<i> Active/Void bit (some sources interpret 'V' as 'Navigation receiver
</I>&gt;<i> warning'), and in later versions the FAA indicator mode.  Sentences
</I>&gt;<i> that have an Active/Void send V when there is no fix, so the position
</I>&gt;<i> data is no good.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Let's look at which sentences send what:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>                 GPRMC     GPGLL     GPGGA     GPGSA
</I>&gt;<i> Returns fix      Yes       Yes       Yes        No
</I>&gt;<i> Returns status   No        Yes       Yes        No
</I>&gt;<i> Returns mode     No        No        No         Yes
</I>&gt;<i> Returns A/V      Yes       Yes       No         No
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In addition, some sentences use empty fields to signify invalid data.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My first conclusion from looking at this table is that the designers
</I>&gt;<i> of NMEA 0183 should be hung for galloping incompetence.  But never mind that.
</I>&gt;<i> What are we to make of this mess?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The fact that the FV18 sends GPMRC/GPGLL/GPGGA but not GPGSA
</I>&gt;<i> argues that GPGSA is optional.  I don't see how it can be, since it
</I>&gt;<i> seems to be the only status bit that applies to altitude.  Just how are
</I>&gt;<i> we supposed to know when altitude is valid if it doesn't ship GSA?  
</I>&gt;<i> Can a receiver ever ship a non-empty but invalid altitude?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Which of these override which other bits?  I don't think status is ever
</I>&gt;<i> nonzero when mode is zero. So status overrides mode.  What other such
</I>&gt;<i> relationships are there?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> News flash: it develops that the &quot;Navigation receiver warning&quot; is
</I>&gt;<i> supposed to indicate a valid fix that has a DOP too high or fails
</I>&gt;<i> an elevation test.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ** Future features (?)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *** Subsecond polling
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> gpsd relies on the GPS to periodically send PVT reports to it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Most GPSes send PVT reports once a second.  No GPS I am aware of
</I>&gt;<i> allows you to set a cycle time of less than a second.  This is because
</I>&gt;<i> at 4800bps, a full PVT report takes just under one second in NMEA.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> At 50km/h (31mi/h) that's 13.8 meters change in position between
</I>&gt;<i> updates, about the same as the uncertainty of position under typical
</I>&gt;<i> conditions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There is, however, a way to sample GPSes at higher frequency.  SiRF
</I>&gt;<i> chips, and some others, allow you to shut down periodic notifications
</I>&gt;<i> and poll them for PVT.  At 57600bps we could poll a NMEA GPS 16 times
</I>&gt;<i> a second, and a SiRF one maybe 18 times a second.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Is this worth doing?  Maybe.  It would reduce fix latency, possibly
</I>&gt;<i> to good effect if your GPS is in motion.  Opinions?  Calculations?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *** Set the system time zone from latitude/longitude
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If we're going to give gpsd the capability to set system time via
</I>&gt;<i> ntpd, why not let it set timezone as well?  A good thing for hackers
</I>&gt;<i> travelling with laptops!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The major issue here is that I have not yet found code, or a
</I>&gt;<i> database, that would allow mapping from lon/lat to timezone.
</I>&gt;<i> And the rules change from year to year.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Actually this should be built as a specialized client, as some
</I>&gt;<i> people won't want it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;From &lt;<A HREF="http://www.linuxsa.org.au/tips/time.html">http://www.linuxsa.org.au/tips/time.html</A>&gt;:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     The timezone under Linux is set by a symbolic link from
</I>&gt;<i>     /etc/localtime[1] to a file in the /usr/share/zoneinfo[2] directory
</I>&gt;<i>     that corresponds with what timezone you are in. For example, since I'm
</I>&gt;<i>     in South Australia, /etc/localtime is a symlink to
</I>&gt;<i>     /usr/share/zoneinfo/Australia/South. To set this link, type:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     ln -sf ../usr/share/zoneinfo/your/zone /etc/localtime
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Replace your/zone with something like Australia/NSW or
</I>&gt;<i>     Australia/Perth. Have a look in the directories under
</I>&gt;<i>     /usr/share/zoneinfo to see what timezones are available.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     [1] This assumes that /usr/share/zoneinfo is linked to /etc/localtime as it is under Red Hat Linux.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     [2] On older systems, you'll find that /usr/lib/zoneinfo is used
</I>&gt;<i>     instead of /usr/share/zoneinfo.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Changing the hardlink will, of course, update the system timezone for
</I>&gt;<i> all users.  If I were designing this feature, I'd ensure that the
</I>&gt;<i> system timezone can be overridden by a user-set TZ, but I don't know
</I>&gt;<i> if it actually works that way.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If I'm reading the tea leaves correctly, this functionality is actually
</I>&gt;<i> embedded in the GCC library version of tzset(), so the same method will
</I>&gt;<i> work on any system that uses that.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Problem: system daemons use the timezone set when they start up. You
</I>&gt;<i> can't get them to grok a new one short of rebooting.
