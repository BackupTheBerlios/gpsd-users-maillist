Thanks for the reply, I have managed to get some slightly better results after
many attempts. 

By varying the switches passed on the command line I managed to happen across it
by accident. In an effort to make sure that it was not the apps or anything
else I started gpsd simply with &quot;gpsd /dev/tts/USB0&quot; (my /dev/ttyUSB0 no longer
comes around?) and commenced to check things out. Low and behold things were
working. I do get the flashing data, explained in the faq, but it updates.

I tried going back and using the various switches to see if something else had
changed. With the inclusion of any switch listed above, i.e. the -nN -D 5, it
fails to update. No mater which part I use, it fails to update. With -D 5 if I
read correctly, it should provide output as it comes in. With the -nN it does.
Without the -nN it does not. It drops to the background.

As it is I can get the position updates and a good fix. It does not report
satellites or their information at all. But at least the position is good as
is velocity and heading.

Again, thanks for the reply. I hope some one has some information that can help.

James
