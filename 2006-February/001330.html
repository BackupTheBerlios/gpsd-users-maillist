<PRE>Hi

I recently played a bit with gpsd and u-blox NMEA Mode:

 &gt; 1. Name (preferably with a URL to the vendor's product page or
 &gt; spec sheet).

ublox
<A HREF="http://www.u-blox.de/products/antaris.html">http://www.u-blox.de/products/antaris.html</A>

 &gt; 2. Chipset.  Ideally we'd like to know both the GPS engine chip and
 &gt; the USB-to-serial chip the device uses.  80% of the time this will be
 &gt; SiRF-II + PL2303, but it's the exceptions that are interesting.

Antaris

 &gt; 3. Interface type -- RS232, USB, CF, etc.

RS232

 &gt; 4. Vendor (preferably with a URL to the vendor's website).

ublox
<A HREF="http://www.u-blox.de/">http://www.u-blox.de/</A>

 &gt; 5. gpsd type -- usually this will be 'n'.  If you had to specify
 &gt; a non-NMEA driver type to make gpsd work, give it.

n

 &gt; 6. Version of gpsd you tested with.

gpsd 2.13 (from debian sarge)

 &gt; 7. NMEA protocol version.

don't know exactly

 &gt; 8. List of NMEA sentences the GPS emits.

with deactivated GSA:

$GPRMC,153739.00,A,4741.21478,N,00844.97006,E,0.000,0.00,160206,,,E*6D

$GPGSV,4,4,13,19,21,172,46*46

with activated GSA (but no signal):

$GPRMC,093712.00,A,4741.21478,N,00844.97006,E,0.000,0.00,170206,,,E*68

$GPGSA,A,E,,,,,,,,,,,,,99.99,99.99,99.99*44
$GPGSV,1,1,00*79

with activated GSA (an good signal):

$GPRMC,115720.00,A,4741.21763,N,00844.96548,E,0.000,0.00,170206,,,E*61

$GPGSV,4,4,13,16,23,184,40*44

 &gt; 9. Notes -- anything interesting or unusual about this GPS.

I noticed that even if the GPS Signal was good and the position right,
gpsd never send a position but said there is &quot;no fix&quot;. So I found out
that the GPS send an invalid GSA record with the character 'E' at the
second field. NMEA 0183 defines just the values '1', '2' and '3'.
Looking at nmea_parse.c I found out that the field is converted by
atoi() to an int, resulting in 0 if there is a 'E' character. This
sets the mode to zero resulting in &quot;no fix&quot; mode.

My first attempt was to disable the GSA record at all (with the u-blox
software). This solution works. But thinking about 100 devices
spread in busses I really don't want to manually change all of those.
I thing about a software modification in nmea_parse.c that will do
something like setting the mode to 2 or 3 if it found the 'E'.

A similar problem occurs at the GGA record: The status field returns
not &quot;0&quot; (no fix), &quot;1&quot; (GPS), &quot;2&quot; (DGPS) but &quot;6&quot;! don't know what this
means, but finally it results in an unknown situation.

Here is a quick and dirty hack for the mode problem:

--- /tmp/testgps/nmea_parse.c   2005-02-22 00:14:58.000000000 +0100
+++ gpsd-2.13/nmea_parse.c      2006-02-17 13:30:57.000000000 +0100
@@ -385,6 +385,8 @@
      int i, changed = 0;

      out-&gt;mode_stamp.changed = update_field_i(field[2], &amp;out-&gt;mode);
+    if ( toupper(field[2][0]) == 'E' )
+        out-&gt;mode = 2;
      REFRESH(out-&gt;mode_stamp);
      gpsd_report(3, &quot;GPGSA sets mode %d\n&quot;, out-&gt;mode);
      changed |= update_field_f(field[15], &amp;out-&gt;pdop);


I continue to work at this. You'll hear from me.

Cheers, Andy
