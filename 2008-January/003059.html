<PRE>Hi All.

Was just wondering if anyone else has seen the any of the following 
weirdness after the roll-over from 2007 to 2008?

Both units in question are Garmin 18 LVC, and are being controlled by GPSD 
2.35 beta (SVN 4402) cross-compiled onto an ARM based Gumstix embedded PC.

Unit 1 is out in the field and has been performing flawlessly for the last 
10 days or so. I obtain the Date and Time via the 'D' command to use as an 
event timestamp, which is then directly logged into a file that is later 
uploaded to a server.

As the device rolled over from 2007-12-31 23:59:59 to 2008-01-01 00:00:00, 
all fields bar the Century updated correctly. The century remained at 2007. 
I've checked my source code and the date supplied by GPSD is being directly 
dumped into my log file.... so I'm thinking that there's some glitch with 
the GPS. I will get the users to do a power cycle when I can contact them 
and see what happens then.

Unit 2 is currently sitting on my desk, waiting to be shipped (tomorrow, of 
course). It too was working perfectly up until end of year. However, this 
unit is now absolutely adamant that the date is 2008-01-02 - i.e. one day 
LATER than it really is. I've power cycled it, and upgraded the firmware as 
a last resort, but GPSD still tells me that the date is 2 Jan, not 1 Jan.

Question:
Has anyone else seen either of these behaviours? If so, is it confined to 
GPSD, the GPS or a combination of both - or has there been something happen 
to the GPS satellite system (extremely unlikely!)

I can't do anything about the unit currently in the field, but have got a 
small window of opportunity to do some more testing before the unit on my 
desk has to leave. I guess I can always post process the data to correct 
the date.

All suggestions appreciated.

ciao, Dave
