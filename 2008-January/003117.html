<PRE>Hi,

 

I spent quite a lot of days in trying to make gpsd (v2.34 and v2.36)
work with the built-in GPS receiver in Panasonic CF-19 toughbook.

But it simply cannot.

 

An example output is given at the end of this message. In summary, the
gpsd program only recognizes several NMEA messages it received.
Eventually, gpsd program actually kill the gps receiver. Then there is
no way to receive any gps data, no matter what tool, minicom, gpsdrive,
etc are used.

 

I think the gpsd-2.34 and later version have some bug issues because
when I fallback the gpsd to an older version, e.g. gpsd 2.22. It
suddenly works.

 

The info about the gps receiver:

 

Manufacturer Matsushita Communications Industry Co. (Japan) Model
CN-GX0290A Receive Frequency 1575.42 MHz Number of Satellites 12
satellites (12 channels, parallel trace, all in view)

Measurement Accuracy 10meter 2dRMS (w/o selective availability) Warm
Start Time within 35 seconds Cold Start Time within 45 seconds
Measurement Period 1 second Datum WGS-84 Port Settings

- 4800 bps / asynchronous

- Data bits 8

- Parity None

- Stop bit 1

Data Format ASCII NMEA0183 ver. 3.0

 

A typical output of gpsd-2.34 looks as follows:

 

[<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-users">root at wasp</A> ~]# gpsd -n -N -D 6 /dev/ttyS3
