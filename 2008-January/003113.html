<PRE>Hi Folks,

I have managed to get my NavMan PiN 570 working with gpsd.

I am going to detail what I did and what issues I faced so if anyone else
wants to do the same they can hopefully get some clues from here.

I also a tidy up question. :)

The 570 runs Pocket Pc 2003 and has a 9600 baud gps module.

The module reports its version as 2.3.2-GSW2-2.05.024-C1Prod1

There were several difficulties I faced:

1) The GPS module powers down when you leave the SmartST software shipped
with the 570.
2) The NMEA GGA sentence is not output by default by the GPS module.
3) How do I connect to gpsd with the output of the gps module which is
running windows ce and running on a hardware with no external interfaces
apart from ActiveSync.

1: 

There is a Gps Power applet in the control panel. By decompiling the applet
I could tell they were controlling the GPS power using the DeviceIoControl
API call with device 'BKL1:', which is normally a backlight control. 

The 570 has a backlight, and it is also controlled in this way. Using brute
force I found that if you pass a control word of 0x40e, you can change the
state of the GPS Module. A CEDEVICE_POWER_STATE of D0 will turn the device
off. D1 will turn it on and make the status LED blink, D2 will turn it on
and make the status LED steady.

The full API call was: 

HANDLE hdev = CreateFile(_T(&quot;BKL1:&quot;), GENERIC_READ, GENERIC_WRITE, 0, NULL,
OPEN_EXISTING, 0, NULL);
DWORD ControlWord = 0x40e;
CEDEVICE_POWER_STATE powerState = D2;
BOOL iocResult = DeviceIoControl(hdev, controlWord, &amp;powerState, 4, NULL, 0,
NULL, NULL);
CloseHandle(hdev);

2:

This was a bit of a learning curve. I knew nothing of the NMEA sentences,
and could not figure out why other apps could not get a fix off the module.
I found WinFast Navigator, and found that if I reset the NMEA sentence
frequencies, the gps would work with other software.

I logged the output of the module before and after a WinFast reset, and
found the GGA sentence was missing.

It was then a simple case of opening the serial port (Com8, 9600N81) and
sending the NMEA sentence to get GGA to be output again.

The command was:

'PSRF103,00,00,01,01*xx'where XX is the checksum.

I am happy to throw up the full source code I use if anyone is interested.

3:

The next step was to try get the gps output to gpsd. I usually Sync with 570
with windows XP, but I use Ubuntu on my laptop. The 570 syncs over USB.

I found that the synce packet will let me establish a ppp connection between
the 570 and my laptop over USB.

I wrote a small app that simply listens for a TCP connection, and outputs
anything on COM8 to any client that connects. Netcat then allows be to
connect to that port and view the GPS info.

On the laptop I simply 'nc 192.168.3.3 4000 | sudo gpsd -n -N -D3
/dev/stdin'

I have since found that I may need a '-j' to gpsd to stop the '3D fix, 2D
fix, no fix' flickering.

This leads me to my question:

If I don't want to use netcat, but have gpsd know about and connect to the
gps via tcp itself, will I need to write a device driver for gpsd, or is
there a generic networking type gps driver?

I hope this info is of use and interest to someone.

Here is a snapshot of the output of the module when GGA is enabled:
