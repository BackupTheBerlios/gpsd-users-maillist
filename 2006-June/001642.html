&gt;<i> Yes this is a possibility but you need a special GPS unit to do this. 
</I>&gt;<i> The gps is not determining the position of it's two antennas but instead 
</I>&gt;<i> measuring the phase difference of the signals that it receives from both 
</I>&gt;<i> antennas. This is how it can determine heading information more 
</I>&gt;<i> precisely. This kind of GPS is going to cost a lot of money.
</I>
Because of money I'm still thinking about magnetic measurement with TNTC
which I need anyway for levelling.

&gt;<i> I didn't add pitch and roll to gpsd because I didn't need it at the time.
</I>
We discuss at the gpsd-devel list about implementation of pitch and
roll. Could you then do a little testing for the code of Robin L
Darroch? Nobody owns a unit at the moment.

&gt;<i> It is only necessary to re-calibrate if the environment around the 
</I>&gt;<i> compass changes because metal was introduced or removed. If it is 
</I>&gt;<i> mounted away from metal and electrical current then it isn't necessary 
</I>&gt;<i> to recalibrate ever. 
</I>
If we manage to get gpsd reporting pitch and roll I'm not sure if I can
do the calibration once with the Windows application and if the
calibration is done on the chip? Could be that only the Windows software
does the calibration?

The unit will be mounted on top of the positioner on a aluminium frame.
Eventhough the main part of the machine is made of unmagnetic stainless
steal, the magnetic compass of a Magellan Meridian is heavily irritated.

&gt;<i> The user manual that comes from True North is top 
</I>&gt;<i> notch and very detailed.
</I>
I noticed that. Also email contact was very qualified.

&gt;<i> With the TN compass we 
</I>&gt;<i> had 0.1 degree accuracy for heading which is far better than a gps could 
</I>&gt;<i> provide.
</I>
A 2 antenna gps could do that too. At a higher price.

&gt;<i> A cheaper alternative might be a development kit I found at Silicon 
</I>&gt;<i> Labs:  
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.silabs.com/tgwWebApp/public/web_content/products/Microcontrollers/en/F350-COMPASS-RD.htm">http://www.silabs.com/tgwWebApp/public/web_content/products/Microcontrollers/en/F350-COMPASS-RD.htm</A>
</I>
Back to gpsd: The great advantage of the TNTC is the use of NMEA, so
implemenation into gpsd would be easy. I also doubt a sophisticated
calibration for this sensor.

Best regards,
Massimo
