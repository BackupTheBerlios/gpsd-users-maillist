<PRE>&gt;<i>Compiler bug.  I managed to reproduce it, then banish it.  Here's 
</I>&gt;<i>what's in the TODO file now:
</I>
&gt;<i>*** Compiling with --enable-max-devices=1 may trigger a gcc optimizer
</I>bug

Wow, that's amazing that we just happen to be using the same gcc
version.  It would have taken a lot of work to track this down
otherwise.

So will compiling with --enable-max-devices=1 result in a dramatic
difference is processor utilization? It seems I was a bit ahead of
myself in reporting that the new code was using about the same processor
as the hacked 2.33 code.  After running the new gpsd with my application
it looked like procesor utilization was about the same as gpsd before
the hack.  The system became very sluggish and the load average was up
over 4.  Putting the hacked gpsd code back in place returned the system
to around a load average of  a little over 1.

I have found out that uclibc does not support profiling but profiling
can be done using separate tools.  I'm in the process now of building
valgrind and the Linux Trace Toolkit for my system.  I'm going to wait
until I get these tools ready before I do more testing unless setting
--enable-max-devices should have a significant impact.
