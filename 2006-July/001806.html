</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; I have a GPS unit (a Fortune GPSmart) which consistently reports the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; wrong position.  The position is out by about 20m in one direction,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; and just under 10m in the other.  Is it possible to put a correction
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; factor into the gpsd configuration so that it does not appear that I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; am driving through the fields next to the motorway?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; We don't currently have such a feature.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Would it be sensible to add it, or is there a more logical place?  If
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; this is a logical place I will try to add the code and submit a patch.

</I>&gt;<i> Hi David,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What you are asking for is a GIS function, that is included in many
</I>&gt;<i> GIS/mapping packages out there.
</I>&gt;<i> What one does is snap the gps points to a vector network that
</I>&gt;<i> represents the roads.
</I>This would not help me as many of the points I wish to map are not on 
roads (I run a rural wireless broadband network and I want to map both
my access points many of which are on farm buildings and the general
wireless reception).  
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think it doesn't make any sense to incluse this on gpsd, since that
</I>&gt;<i> deviation should be time and position dependent, and also map
</I>&gt;<i> dependent .
</I>This error seems to be quite constant over the area I cover (an area about
20 miles by 20 miles) and that is the only one that concerns me.  It was 
also consistant when I drove from near Oxford to Birmingham, but I have not
tried taking it out of country.

It has been consistant for the last 3 years, ever since I got the unit.

The main app I use when driving is gpsdrive, and I have not seen such a
feature on that program.

Is it possible to &quot;chain&quot; applications, i.e. for me to write a filter
in between gpsd and gpsdrive?  Obviously it would have to run on a different
port to the standard one, but then I could do this without modifying either.
Alternatively does gpsd have any facility for running extra code on the 
received data before it gets handed on to the main app(gpsd in this case)?

&gt;<i> Most of the time, we have maps that were made with a scale, and are
</I>&gt;<i> only accurate to that scale. GPS also have an accuracy, but as the
</I>&gt;<i> position is indicated up to the centimetre range, we rely on that when
</I>&gt;<i> we should trust it up to 50m.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, your position error is well within the expected accuracy of the
</I>&gt;<i> Global Positioning System.
