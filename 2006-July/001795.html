<PRE>Compiling with --enable-max-client-fd=8 and --enable-max-devices=1
produces

~$ gpsd -n -N -D 1 /dev/ttyS2
gpsd: launching (version 2.33)
gpsd: listening on port 2947
gpsd: opening GPS data source at '/dev/ttyS2'
gpsd: speed 4800, 8N1
gpsd: gpsd_activate: opened GPS (5)
Segmentation fault

Compiling with -D_FD_SETSIZE=8 and removing the --enable max-devices
and max-client-fd stops the segmentation fault but processor utilization
is around 50 - 60 percent which is about what I get with the hacked gpsd
version.

I don't know why I was seeing 20-30 percent earlier today unless it had
something to do with that code being broken.  The utilization I'm seeing
now may be because I'm getting data from gpsd by querying it every
second.  I tried implementing a call back function in my code but that
caused my application to seg fault even though the callback function
would actually get data from gpsd once before seg faulting.  This may
have something to do with the way pthreads are implemented in the uClibc
library.

I guess profiling is going to be the best option for figuring out
what's going on as far as utilization goes.  If you can figure out why
gpsd is seg faulting with the max client and max devices options I can
recompile and test.  

How much improvement do you think I should see with max-devices set to
1?  Is it worth trying or should I just wait until I get profiling
enabled?

</I>Marshall Crocker &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-users">crocker at cavs.msstate.edu</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> I still haven't taken time to figure out how to enable profiling
</I>with
&gt;<i> my cross toolchain.  The 20% - 30% utilization is ok for now so I'm
</I>&gt;<i> going to save the profiling for later.
</I>
One of my to-do items is to modify configure.ac to make building for
profiling easier.  Fortunately, it seems the existing
--enable-profiling
is a knob with no mechanism attached; I think that happened when I
implemented the $ command and scrapped the previous iteration of 
profiling support.
 
&gt;<i> I see those options now in the configure script.  The max-client-fd
</I>&gt;<i> limits the numer of clients correct? 
</I>
It does what it says, limiting the maximum fd that gpsd can use.  This
is not
exactly the same as limiting the maximum client count; fds are not 
nercssarily allocated consecutively from the point of view of any
given
userspace program, and some fds get allocated to GPS devices rather
than
client sessions.

I'm going to have to go stare at that code for a while.  The
difference
is subtle and could trip someone up.  Maybe there's a better way.

&gt;<i>                                  This option should be the same as
</I>&gt;<i> compiling with  -D_FD_SETSIZE=n right?
</I>
That, on the other hand, is true.

&gt;<i>                                           And the max-devices limits
</I>the
&gt;<i> number of gps devices? I didn't realize gpsd could support more than
</I>one
&gt;<i> gps device connected to the system.
</I>
Sure can.  Users can switch channels among any number of GPS devices
up to the compiled-in maximum.  Comes in handy if (say) you have two
GPSes at bow and stern of an oil tanker.

&gt;<i> I'll compile with max-client-fd=8 and max-devices=1 and report the
</I>&gt;<i> performance with these options.
</I>
Looking forward to it.
