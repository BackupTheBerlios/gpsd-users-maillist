I cannot see them on a PC either.

</I>
Well, in our case, the problem was twofold:

	1.  The main loop seems to be a bit too expensive for an embedded
device.  Just going through 1024 array elements 3 times (once for all
potential gps devices, once for all potential clients and a second time
for all clients if nowait is unset) takes enough time to be noticeable.

	2.  At least with our embedded device, the select would return for each
_character_ returned by the gps device, which really made 1) a big
problem.  Adding the sleep() meant that we'd always be able to read a
full line, and only run through the main loop once a second.

&gt;<i> What are your thoughts?
</I>
Problem number 1 is a problem both when it comes to performace and
especially when it comes to memory consumption.  Many embedded devices
have no MMU, and therefore no swapping capabilities.  Allocating 1024 *
sizeof(subscriber_t) + 1024 * sizeof(gps_device_t) (gps_device_t is
_huge_!) is a major resource problem.

Problem number 2 may be a serial port configuration issue I guess.
Maybe if the port was initialized with ICANON, things would be better?
We did try that with our device, but without success.  Didn't check why
though.

Possible solutions:

I have a patch solving problem number 1.  It adds two new parameters to
configure, limiting the maximum number of gps devices and the maximum
file descriptor of the clients.  I'm not very pleased with it though,
I'd like to try changing how the subscribers array is used, and add the
client's file descriptor to the subscriber_t, just as what's done with
the gps_device_t type, so that one can set the maximum number of
clients, rather than the maximum value of the clients' file descriptor.

Problem number two is harder.  I don't think you'd like a sleep() in the
main loop as it is a rather ugly hack.  But I'm not sure if configuring
the serial port differently is good either, setting ICANON would surely
be a bad idea for binary protocols?  This problem may be locally
solvable on our side by making sure the serial port is properly
configured before starting gpsd.
