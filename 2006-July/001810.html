<PRE>2006/7/31, David Goodenough &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-users">david.goodenough at btconnect.com</A>&gt;:

&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; What you are asking for is a GIS function, that is included in many
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; GIS/mapping packages out there.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; What one does is snap the gps points to a vector network that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; represents the roads.
</I>&gt;<i> This would not help me as many of the points I wish to map are not on
</I>&gt;<i> roads (I run a rural wireless broadband network and I want to map both
</I>&gt;<i> my access points many of which are on farm buildings and the general
</I>&gt;<i> wireless reception).
</I>
If you have those buildings on a map, aerial photo or satellite
imagery (provided both are properly georeferenced - not the case with
Google Earth!) use these coordinates instead of those from the GPS. As
I said, GPS coordinates are accurate up to 50m in general.

Look here: <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPS#Accuracy">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPS#Accuracy</A>
and here: <A HREF="http://users.erols.com/dlwilson/gps.htm">http://users.erols.com/dlwilson/gps.htm</A>

&gt;<i> The main app I use when driving is gpsdrive, and I have not seen such a
</I>&gt;<i> feature on that program.
</I>
Probably it's because gpsdrive doesn't know about vector networks -
have a look at a real GIS package, like GRASS (<A HREF="http://grass.itc.it">http://grass.itc.it</A>),
but probably is overkill for your application.
I don't recall right know of another GIS that may have this feature,
other than ESRI...But then it's overkill too.

&gt;<i> Is it possible to &quot;chain&quot; applications, i.e. for me to write a filter
</I>&gt;<i> in between gpsd and gpsdrive?  Obviously it would have to run on a different
</I>
I am not the right person to advise on this.

Remeber, if your gps data points disagree with your map less than 50
or 100m, and it's not good enough, then you should consider doing a
DGPS survey. Then you could go all the way down to centimetre level.

The GPS specs states positioning accuracy better than 100m 95% of the
time. Better than 50m 67% of the time.

&gt;<i> &gt; So, your position error is well within the expected accuracy of the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Global Positioning System.
