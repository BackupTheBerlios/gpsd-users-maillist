<PRE>Eivind Tagseth &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-users">eivindt-gmane at multinet.no</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> 	1.  The main loop seems to be a bit too expensive for an embedded
</I>&gt;<i> device.  Just going through 1024 array elements 3 times (once for all
</I>&gt;<i> potential gps devices, once for all potential clients and a second time
</I>&gt;<i> for all clients if nowait is unset) takes enough time to be noticeable.
</I>
I like Wallace Owen's idea of tracking the upper bound on that loop by
watching accept(2) returns.  I have code that I think implements that;
I need to test it.  In the typical case it should reduce the poll cycle
time by a factor of about a thousand!

Wallace's approach fits the philosophy I'm trying to carry through the
whole project, which is that as much as possible gpsd should configure
itself for best operation by watching its environment, rather than
relying on directives passed in by humans.
 
&gt;<i> Problem number 1 is a problem both when it comes to performace and
</I>&gt;<i> especially when it comes to memory consumption.  Many embedded devices
</I>&gt;<i> have no MMU, and therefore no swapping capabilities.  Allocating 1024 *
</I>&gt;<i> sizeof(subscriber_t) + 1024 * sizeof(gps_device_t) (gps_device_t is
</I>&gt;<i> _huge_!) is a major resource problem.
</I>
That's because FD_SETSIZE is normally 1024 on modern machines, of
course.  That's *way* larger than any set of devices I can imagine
being hooked up to gpsd, but I dislike having artificial limits in my
code when memory is cheap.

In the SBC context, however, your point is more than fair.  I think
this is best addressed by reducing the size of that array at
compilation time in environments where you know in advance that (a)
you're memory-constrained, and (b) there will be few devices.

&gt;<i> Problem number 2 may be a serial port configuration issue I guess.
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe if the port was initialized with ICANON, things would be better?
</I>&gt;<i> We did try that with our device, but without success.  Didn't check why
</I>&gt;<i> though.
</I>
Starting serial ports with ICANON would break the type-hunting logic,
making it unable to sync up devices that send binary packets.  I like
the idea of setting it in the NMEA driver, though.  That would be 
a nice efficiency hack.  I'll put that on the to-do list.

&gt;<i> Possible solutions:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I have a patch solving problem number 1.  It adds two new parameters to
</I>&gt;<i> configure, limiting the maximum number of gps devices and the maximum
</I>&gt;<i> file descriptor of the clients.  I'm not very pleased with it though,
</I>&gt;<i> I'd like to try changing how the subscribers array is used, and add the
</I>&gt;<i> client's file descriptor to the subscriber_t, just as what's done with
</I>&gt;<i> the gps_device_t type, so that one can set the maximum number of
</I>&gt;<i> clients, rather than the maximum value of the clients' file descriptor.
</I>
I think I only need part of this patch now, if Wallace Owen's idea
works out (and I think it will)
 
&gt;<i> Problem number two is harder.  I don't think you'd like a sleep() in the
</I>&gt;<i> main loop as it is a rather ugly hack.
</I>
Quite right; not only is it ugly, I don't like anything that adds latency.

&gt;<i>                                 But I'm not sure if configuring
</I>&gt;<i> the serial port differently is good either, setting ICANON would surely
</I>&gt;<i> be a bad idea for binary protocols? 
</I>
It is, as I noted above.

&gt;<i>                                      This problem may be locally
</I>&gt;<i> solvable on our side by making sure the serial port is properly
</I>&gt;<i> configured before starting gpsd.
</I>
You shouldn't have to do that.  If you can live with expensive polling
for a few seconds while gpsd syncs to the device type, it seems to
me that setting ICANON in the initialization function of the NMEA
driver would be useful.  I'd take a patch for that instantly.

Even the startup overhead could be eliminated, in principle.  If you
want to hack the configuration machinery so people deploying on SBCs
can wire gpsd down to a single device type, avoiding the hunt logic
altogether, I'd take a patch for that too.  

I'd refuse a gpsd startup option for this purpose because it would 
tempt us to be lazy and not get the autoconfiguration problem right 
in PC environments where it matters.  But a compile-time option -- 
so long as it's not the default -- would be acceptable.
