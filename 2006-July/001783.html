Eric:

Thanks for the reply.

With regards to the gpsfake problems that I was having...

I stood up gpsd quickly on an kickstart FC5 box, the one that I was having
problems with. Here is the version information:

fuser / psmic: fuser (PSmisc) 22.2
kernel: 2.6.17-1.2157_FC5
python: Python 2.4.3
os: Fedora Core release 5 (Bordeaux)

I also have a laptop that I was issued for work (unfortunately required to
run XP), which has VMware Workstation 5.5 on it for a VM R&amp;D project that I
am investigating. I installed a minimalist FC5 VM on that machine, and
compiled gpsd. I connected up my GPS devices and started to log data (VMware
does pretty well with external peripherals). The strange thing is, when I
ran gpsfake on this VM with the data I logged, everything worked just fine,
except I needed to be in the build directory to get rid of the initial
gpsfake error messages about not being able to find the gpsfake module.

The OS installations were nearly identical.

At the moment, I would not be able to tell you anymore about this laptop
setup. We are required to have fully encrypted hard drives, and the hard
drive encryption software on my laptop crashed about 30 minutes ago. SO...
due to the security, I might have to consider this data lost forever. Oh,
the irony.


Regards,
Matthew

PS - I saw Revolution OS about a month ago, and read The Cathedral and the
Bazaar too. I just want to say thank you for your contributions!
