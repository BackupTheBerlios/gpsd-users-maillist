It may also be useful to look at the more general issue of using dead 
reckoning to reduce GPS startup and lock times.

About 10 years ago I worked on a project that used a MEMS IMU to track 
position and orientation changes while the GPS was off, and used the 
information to accelerate the time to first fix when the GPS was turned on.

The information was used to select the satellites in view (assuming the 
almanac was still current), and to initialize several calculations.  We 
also hacked the GPS firmware, so I have no idea if our approach was in 
any way comparable to what AGPS does in cell phones today.

An earlier version of the code was used for an LEO pico-sat that had 
extreme power limitations.  Instead of an IMU, we used orbit propagation 
and a good clock to determine which satellites were in view, and we also 
had to pre-computed the large Doppler corrections for each satellite.  
In the best case, we could power up, initialize, get two fixes and shut 
down in about 4 seconds!  We used the fixes to update the orbital elements.

I do not know if gpsd supports (or permits) sending initialization 
information to a GPS, but if a protocol exists, it may make sense for 
gpsd to eventually support it.
