Thanks for the tip. But to be honest, I do not understand the scenario
when to use the hook method. If the hook is only called when I call
gps_poll(), I can also unregister the hook and call the hook function
myself directly after gps_poll(), right? Moreover, the hook is also
called if POLL_NOBLOCK is set and gps_poll() returns 0 because there
is no data waiting, which makes the hook quite useless for me, as I
want to know if new data was polled or if I'm reusing old data.
