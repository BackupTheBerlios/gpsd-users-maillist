</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Hello,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I just heared about assisted GPS and I'm now searching for a how2 or
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> something else, how i could enable it with gpsd and a normal GPS  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> mouse on
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> my laptop.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I found some discussions on the net that i should work, but not  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> how it
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> works.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> We don't know how to do this.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It requires picking up and interpreting information broadcast by
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> cellphone towers, so it would at minimum need another receiver
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (separate from the GPS mouse) operating in those frequency bands. Of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> course, a cellphone has one of those built in.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> There's another level of the problem, too. Supposing we had the  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> right sort
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of receiver, AGPS systems are carrier-dependent.  As far as we know
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> there isn't any standard for the format of the corrections.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I think you're the third person to bring this up.   I should probably
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> do a FAQ entry on this.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As far as I know, there are two parts to A-GPS.... First there is the:
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;which tower am I on, and where is it located?&quot; Somehow cellphones can
</I>&gt;<i> do this, and provide a location estimate well before the GPS can have
</I>&gt;<i> a signal lock.
</I>I have an hspa modem, so i could get informations from the modem - the  
problem is that you need information about the protocol (which is not  
standard afaik) how the modem exchanges these data with the pc (eg my  
modem creates 3 tty devices but only one works as a real modem...
May a interface with a map and a pointer could help to find out where  
i'm should be, when you are in the middle of nowhere this might not  
work but then you will probably not have an internet connection too :P
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Secondly there is some information, which is transmitted from the GPS
</I>&gt;<i> satelites at a low baud rate. If all goes well (an ideal signal), this
</I>&gt;<i> information takes up to 2 minutes to transmit/recieve. This is
</I>&gt;<i> neccesary to obtain a position fix. On the other hand, you can just as
</I>&gt;<i> well download this information from the internet. It's the same all
</I>&gt;<i> over the world (but changes fast enough that 3 hours later it's
</I>&gt;<i> invalid enough for my GPS not to trust it anymore)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Provided we'd know where to get this information, and in what format
</I>&gt;<i> it is, we could download it with whatever internet link we happen to
</I>&gt;<i> have.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> However sending it to the GPS unit poses another problem. There
</I>&gt;<i> usually simply isn't any protocol to do this...
</I>I dont really understand... Does the wlan chip say &quot;position fix&quot; or  
is it implemented in the gps software? I always thougth that the gps  
chip just receive information from the satelites and writes them to  
the tty?
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (on the other hand, for example the SIRF chipset needs to be able to
</I>&gt;<i> be built-into a cellphone. So the cellphone needs to be able to tell
</I>&gt;<i> it the &quot;assist&quot; information. A GPS mouse need not consist of much more
</I>&gt;<i> than a SIRF chipset, plus a bluetooth&lt;-&gt;serial chipset plus a
</I>&gt;<i> battery. So therefore it is possible that sending the right strings
</I>&gt;<i> over bluetooth works.)
</I>Yay but may these wires are not connected... A little soldering should  
help?

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    Roger.
