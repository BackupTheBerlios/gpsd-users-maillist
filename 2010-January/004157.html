</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hello,

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; my laptop.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I found some discussions on the net that i should work, but not how it

</I>&gt;<i>

As far as I know, there are two parts to A-GPS.... First there is the:
&quot;which tower am I on, and where is it located?&quot; Somehow cellphones can
do this, and provide a location estimate well before the GPS can have
a signal lock.

Secondly there is some information, which is transmitted from the GPS
satelites at a low baud rate. If all goes well (an ideal signal), this
information takes up to 2 minutes to transmit/recieve. This is
neccesary to obtain a position fix. On the other hand, you can just as
well download this information from the internet. It's the same all
over the world (but changes fast enough that 3 hours later it's
invalid enough for my GPS not to trust it anymore)

Provided we'd know where to get this information, and in what format
it is, we could download it with whatever internet link we happen to
have.

However sending it to the GPS unit poses another problem. There
usually simply isn't any protocol to do this.... 

(on the other hand, for example the SIRF chipset needs to be able to
be built-into a cellphone. So the cellphone needs to be able to tell
it the &quot;assist&quot; information. A GPS mouse need not consist of much more
than a SIRF chipset, plus a bluetooth&lt;-&gt;serial chipset plus a
battery. So therefore it is possible that sending the right strings
over bluetooth works.)

Q: It doesn't work. A: Look buddy, doesn't work is an ambiguous statement. 
Does it sit on the couch all day? Is it unemployed? Please be specific! 
Define 'it' and what it isn't doing. --------- Adapted from lxrbot FAQ
