<PRE>Somil Asthana &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-users">somilasthana at lycos.com</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i>   Although what you said make sense but I feel there is some configuration problem. When I use the same card with Pocket PC on COM5 port it works fine. Pocket PC is able to acquire a GPS &amp; connects to it but when I try to do the same with Linux iPAQ I get bad results (the room setting all are same). Further I noticed that same syslogd msg is generated when you unplug the GPS card which makes me to believe that gpsd is not actually contacting the GPS satellite. Are you sure I am doing the right thing ? I am using Familiar OS 5.2 on IPAQ 3870 &amp; GlobalSat BC-307 card
</I>
Here are the installation and testing instructions  I am in the process of
writing up in response to your issue:

Here are the steps for installing gpsd and verifying its performance:

1. Start by making sure you can get data from your GPS, otherwise the later
steps will be very frustrating.  In this command

      stty -F /dev/ttyXXX ispeed 4800; cat &lt;/dev/ttyUSB0

replace ttyXXX with the filename of the port.  This will probably be
either /dev/ttyUSB0 or /dev/ttyS0.  When you run this command, you
should see text lines beginning with $ come to stdout (possibly after
a short initial burst of binary garbage).  If you don't see this, you
may have OS-level problems with your serial support, but more likely
have the wrong device.  Look again.

2. Make a symlink named /dev/gps to your GPS port; the command will be

     ln -s /dev/ttyXXX /dev/gps

where ttyXXX is as in step 1.

3. Build gpsd from source (skip this step if you have installed a gpsd
binary package).

You will need to have either Motif or LessTif installed in order for
gps and xgpsspeed to build.  If you're on a Linux system, you probably
already have LessTif.  Source code is available from
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.lesstif.org/">http://www.lesstif.org/</A>&gt;.

To build from source, run ./autogen.sh (or sh autogen.sh if the
script does not have execute permission).  Then run make: libgps.so,
gpsd, gps, and xgpsspeed will be built. Copy the app-defaults files
gps.ad and xgpsspeed.ad to your home directory or to the system-wide X
app-defaults directory.

4. Determine whether you need a non-NMEA driver.  Usually you will not,
but there are unusual exceptions.  Consult the hardware page at

    <A HREF="http://gpsd.berlios.de/hardware.html">http://gpsd.berlios.de/hardware.html</A>

to find out if your hardware is one of them.  If so, you may need to
specify a driver type option at gpsd startup time; if you installed 
a binary RPM, this will mean editing the gpsd init script.

5. Start gpsd on a serial or USB port that has the GPS connected to it.
If you made a /dev/gps symlink, just invoking &quot;gpsd&quot; as root should do it.
If you installed from an RPM, gpsd will be started for you automatically 
at boot time.

6. Once gpsd is running, telnet to port 2947.  Type &quot;r&quot; to start raw
and watcher modes.  You should see NMEA data (text lines beginning
with $) spewing out.  You will also see lines with a GPSD prefix;
these are sentence translations in GPSD protocol.

Note that until your GPS has acquired a fix, typing &quot;p&quot; to get position
will only return this:

GPSD,P=?

This response does not mean that gpsd is broken or that the GPS is not
sending data, merely that gpsd has not yet seen any *valid* position data.
You will have to wait for the GPS to acquire satellite lock.  If you have 
raw or watcher mode on it should be obvious when you get a lock.

7. Start the gps client.  Calling it with no arguments should do the right 
thing.  You should see a GUI panel with position/velocity-time information,
and a satellite display.  The displays won't look very interesting until 
the GPS acquires satellite lock.

8. Check out the list of supported hardware at 

   <A HREF="http://gpsd.berlios.de/hardware.html">http://gpsd.berlios.de/hardware.html</A>

If your GPS isn't on the list, please send us information to add a new
line to the table.  Here's what we need:

1. Name (preferably with a URL to the vendor's product page or spec sheet).
2. Chipset.  Ideally we'd like to know both the GPS engine chip and
   the USB-to-serial chip the device uses.  80% of the time this will be
   SiRF-II + PL2303, but it's the exceptions that are interesting.
3. Interface type -- RS232, USB, CF, etc.
4. Vendor (preferably with a URL to the vendor's website).
5. gpsd type -- usually this will be 'n'.  If you had to specify a
   non-NMEA driver type to make gpsd work, give it.
6. Version of gpsd you tested with.
7. NMEA protocol version.
8. List of NMEA sentences the GPS emits.
9. Notes -- anything interesting or unusual about this GPS.

You may get some help on fields 2, 7, and 8 by running gpsprobe.  Note that
you will have to stop gpsd to do this.

We can also use updates of the latest version number known to work with
hardware already supported.
