<PRE>&gt;<i> &gt; try debugging NMEA with GtkTerm or minicom.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I tried minicom but didn't know what to do from there ... are there
</I>&gt;<i> interactive commands I can type at the GPS unit?
</I>
nope, set correct serial port (eg /dev/ttyS0 for COM1) and settings
(4800,n,8,1) then sit and listen.

avoid /dev/gps until /dev/ttyS? is working.


&gt;<i> &gt; comm settings at GPS end? 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> These are the choices under SETUP / INTERFACE
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I/O Format    Baud  Beacon  Bit rate  Freq       
</I>&gt;<i> -----------   ----  ------  --------  ---------  
</I>&gt;<i> GARMIN
</I>&gt;<i> GARMIN DGPS   4800  SCAN    200       300.0 KHz (scans)
</I>&gt;<i> NMEA          4800
</I>&gt;<i> TEXT OUT      4800
</I>&gt;<i> RTCM IN       4800
</I>&gt;<i> RTCM/NMEA     4800  SCAN    200       300.0 KHz (scans)
</I>&gt;<i> RTCM/TEXT     4800
</I>

That's ok, but there should be another menu that lets you pick which of
those will be be used. You want NMEA (out).

if you are still stuck you might buy a LED breakout box from your local
electronics store so you can see the lights blink when something is sent
down the wire.

This is a built in serial port, not on a PCMCIA card, right? (if so
there
may be TTL-&gt;RS232 issues)


&gt;<i> Under the two DGPS settings, there's a USER option under beacon, which
</I>&gt;<i> also allows you to set the bit rate and frequency. From what I can
</I>&gt;<i> tell neither of those are for me; I don't even know what a
</I>&gt;<i> Differential GPS is. :)
</I>
Once upon a time, one arm of the US military scrambled the civilian
version of the GPS signal to hinder its use by ne'er do wells.
Another arm of the military (coast guard) found this to be annoying, so
set up a system of surveyed ground stations and broadcast via VHF radio
corrections which when merged with the GPS signals could get you from
100 foot to 10 foot accuracy (DGPS) which is handy for getting ships
into channels in zero-viz.. The FAA decided the would be cool for
airplanes as well but because of lack of DGPS coverage away from the
coasts they decided to put up their own correction satellite (WAAS).
Then in May 2000 Pres. Clinton decided that the whole scramble-then-
unscramble thing was stupid &amp; holding back emergency service uses (eg
which side of the interstate to send the fire truck to) so he did away
with the introduced scrambling (SA) on the civilian frequency.

[or something like that]

Note DGPS (as multi-band military GPS and WAAS) will do some corrections
for ionospheric errors, so DGPS is still better than unscrambled-GPS.

I doubt this is the case.
