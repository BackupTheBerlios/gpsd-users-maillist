<PRE>Thanks to all those that replied!

&gt;<i> If you have a 'slow' PC (I encountered this on a PIII 1GHz), I found
</I>&gt;<i> that the act of turning on the -D5 debugging with the -N option was
</I>&gt;<i> enough
</I>
I don't think that it's due to the speed of the PC. That was actaully my
first thought. I was testing on a laptop (I wanted something I could
install and test on and wipe clean) - and had timing issues.
I noticed that it was pretty bad about just syncronizing with NTP peers,
regardless of anything else - so I decided to try a desktop to eliminate
any confusion.

So, I am running it on an older (desktop) Athlon XP 2800+, but even
without debugging it doesn't work

&gt;<i>The debug output you show is one resulting from a transition at the end
</I>&gt;<i>of the actual 1pps pulse. The duration is 100532 microseconds, which is
</I>&gt;<i>reasonable for the 1pps pulse. It is rejected because we are interested
</I>&gt;<i>in the transition which happens at the end of the &quot;idle&quot; part of the
</I>&gt;<i>pulse. Hopefully, your debug output would shortly be follwed by a
</I>&gt;<i>transition which produces a duration of about 900000 microseconds that would be
</I>&gt;<i>acceptable.
</I>
Well, I went back to start gpsd to look at the debugging information,
because I Don't remember seeing a duration that long.
And I saw:

gpsd: pps-detect (DCD) on /dev/ttyS0 changed to 1
gpsd: ntpshm_pps: clock: 1191862458 @ 1191862458.004656, precision -7
gpsd: Raw SiRF packet type 0x12 length 2: 1201
gpsd: OTS 0x12: send indicator = 1
gpsd: pps-detect (DCD) on /dev/ttyS0 changed to 0
gpsd: PPS pulse rejected too short. cycle: 1001922, duration: 101387

So......... It looks like it's working properly now, and PPS is locked on,
and accepting the beginning of the PPS pulse?
I have no clue what changed. I just left it running. I think that the GPS
receiver might have some issues with outputting a stable PPS signal. I've
seen that some receivers are poorly designed...

&gt;<i>Is your PPS signal a regular 3V/5V TTL/CMOS output or proper RS-232 level
</I>&gt;<i>signal?  Some RS-232 ports will amazingly work with logic levels though
</I>&gt;<i>they shouldn't, strictly speaking.  Not to mention that the polarity will
</I>&gt;<i>be inverted too but I think GPSD can resolve the polarity problem.
</I>
I don't know to tell you the truth. The documentation I have doesn't
mention anything. Can you tell with a digital voltmeter, even though the
pulse is only 100ms? I don't have an occiloscope...

&gt;<i> See if you can adjust the pulse duty with a command and if that doesn't
</I>Don't see any way to do that... I have a program called &quot;Conductor&quot; thats
specific to Sirf chips - but no mention of changing the pulse duty (or any
of the other vendor docs)

&gt;<i>work then throw an inverter and RS-232 transceiver into the fray.  I have
</I>&gt;<i>had trouble with GPSD not syncing to the PPS properly until I issue a
</I>&gt;<i>manual $PGRMI,,,,,,,R to reset the GPS15H.  I think it's fair to say that
</I>&gt;<i>the PPS code in GPSD needs a bit of lovin'.
</I>
I tried that command (for fun) , but no change.

I'm thinking of getting a Motorola Oncore UT+ module, seems to be real
popular as a signal for stratum 1 time servers..

Anyone have any experience with those? Don't know if it's PPS output is
TTL or not..


Thanks!
Jim
