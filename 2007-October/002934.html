<PRE>Jim,

OK, your first debug output showed:-

gpsd: pps-detect (DCD) on /dev/ttyS0 changed to 1
gpsd: ntpshm_pps: clock: 1191862458 @ 1191862458.004656, precision -7
gpsd: Raw SiRF packet type 0x12 length 2: 1201
gpsd: OTS 0x12: send indicator = 1
gpsd: pps-detect (DCD) on /dev/ttyS0 changed to 0
gpsd: PPS pulse rejected too short. cycle: 1001922, duration: 101387

So you were getting good lock. You don't actually get any debug output 
advising that the PPS pulse is good length, it simply calls ntpshm_pps() 
which does the magic. However, you did get a message from ntpshm_pps saying 
it liked your 1pps data.

If you REALLY wanted to see the timing data, you could add a line like this:-

gpsd_report(LOG_RAW, &quot;PPS pulse OK. cycle: %d,
    duration: %d\n&quot;, cycle, duration);

Put it in to libgpsd_core.c just after the line like this:-

/* looks like PPS pulse */

You would then get output similar to this:-

gpsd: PPS pulse OK. cycle: 1001922, duration: 899387

Doing so would not add much exciting data but WOULD introduce more delay in 
the delivery of the timing data. Only really useful as an educational aide I 
would suggest!

=====================================

Your later debug output showed:-

gpsd: pps-detect (DCD) on /dev/ttyS0 changed to 1
gpsd: ntpshm_pps: lost PPS lock
gpsd: Raw SiRF packet type 0x12 length 2: 1201
gpsd: OTS 0x12: send indicator = 1
gpsd: pps-detect (DCD) on /dev/ttyS0 changed to 0
gpsd: PPS pulse rejected too short. cycle: 989942, duration: 90058

So, you were seeing the same kind of short cycle at the end of the 1pps pulse 
proper in the &quot;changed to 0&quot; message.

The wanted edge at the start of the 1pps is the &quot;changed to 1&quot; message.

This means you are actually getting a +5v leading edge to mark the 1pps event 
which is held for about 100 milliseconds and followed by about 900 
milliseconds of 0v (assuming +5 TTL levels). This is pretty much as you might 
expect and just about what I get from my Oncore UT+ look-alike before it goes 
through the RS232 inverter.

This nominally good signal is then being rejected by the checks inside 
ntpshm_pps() which does a sanity check on the time data associated with the 
pulse.

The ntpshm_pps() code checks that the time message being sent is within a 
certain range of the PC's internal time. The PC time is what ntpd actually 
controls (see case 1 below).

If your gps device is generating time that is too far away from the PC 
internal time, the code will not offer the information to ntpd. I have seen 
this happen when my computer's local time was too far out.

Letting ntpd see an external timeserver over the net for a reasonable time 
brought me nearer to the correct time and then the 1pps was accepted.

If you see any debug messages generated which start &quot;gpsd: ntpshm_pps:&quot; then 
you have seen a reasonable 1pps pulse and have sent time info in the general 
direction of the ntpd daemon.

There are three possible debug outputs from the ntpshm_pps() code:-

1) &quot;ntpshm_pps: not in locking range: &lt;some value&gt;&quot;
This means that the difference between the gps timestamp and the system time 
at which it was received is more than 100 miliseconds. This is defined as too 
far to allow the clock to be &quot;pulled&quot;.

2) &quot;ntpshm_pps: lost PPS lock&quot;
This means that the 1pps timestamp is too far away from an exact 1 second 
boundary; i.e. it is out of lock.

3) &quot;ntpshm_pps: clock: &lt;some value&gt; @ &lt;some non-integer value&gt;, precision n&quot;
This means you have a good lock and the data will be handed over to the ntpd 
daemon via the shared memory block.

By the way, Chris Kuethe pointed out that some inverters can have propagation 
delays of 10's of microseconds so I checked the datasheet for the MAX233 I 
use, as that was something I hadn't given thought to do before.

In this case, the delay on the TTL-RS232 conversion is stated as max 3.5 
microseconds and typical 1.5 microseconds for the both the rising and falling 
transitions, so it seems to be a reasonable device.

Mick
