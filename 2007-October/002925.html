<PRE>Hi Jim,

I have done quite a bit of work on the 1pps with another member of the group 
(David Cottle) and found that we both suffered with the initialisation code 
for the 1pps routine.

When the daemon starts, it scans for incoming data and if it doesn't get a 
match at the first speed, it can end up killing the 1pps monitoring thread. 
This may be what bit you at 38,400bps while 9,600bps works.

We got round it temporarily by a bit of trickery and I am still looking at a 
robust method to offer to the 2.35 codebase. This has proved to be a bit 
trickier than expected when allowing for all combinations of speed scan and 
devices which support probing, but I am still trying.

=================================================

On the debug output, you see that your cycle is 1008017 and your duration is 
100532. Both are in microseconds, so it looks like you are getting a 100 
millisecond pulse every second. This is reasonable and would normally be 
fine. However, bear with me and have a look at the code and check what your 
actual values mean.

The code observes transitions from low to high and vice-versa. It timestamps 
them and after each transition it calculates the time since:-
1) the last transition in the same direction
2) the time since the last transition in the opposite direction.

The time between same-direction events is the repetition rate (cycle) and the 
time between opposite-direction events is the length of the last part of the 
waveform (duration).

The important event is when we get a transition from the end of the 
long &quot;non-active&quot; state to the short &quot;active&quot; state, the 1pps pulse itself.

The 1pps event is defined as being synchronised to this transition and the 
pulse which starts with this event is usually about 100000 to 200000 
microseconds in duration, depending on the device.

The events (once &quot;cycle&quot; and &quot;duration&quot; are calculated) are handled in this 
code lifted from the function &quot;static void *gpsd_ppsmonitor(void *arg)&quot; :-

if ( 800000 &gt; duration) {
    /* less then 800mS, duration too short for anything */
    gpsd_report(LOG_RAW, &quot;PPS pulse rejected too short. cycle: %d, 
        duration: %d\n&quot;, cycle, duration);
} else if (cycle &gt; 999000 &amp;&amp; cycle &lt; 1001000 ) {
    /* looks like PPS pulse */
    (void)ntpshm_pps(session, &amp;tv);
} else if (cycle &gt; 1999000 &amp;&amp; cycle &lt; 2001000) {
    /* looks like 2Hz square wave */
    (void)ntpshm_pps(session, &amp;tv);
} else {
    gpsd_report(LOG_RAW, &quot;PPS pulse rejected. No fix.\n&quot;);
}

There is also handling for a squarewave in there (it should say 0.5Hz, not 2Hz 
if the cycle lasts 2 seconds!), but that is not an issue for you.

The way the edges are timed/processed, the code is independant of the 
polarity, since if it is fed by a correctly formed signal, it will see the 
same value for cycle whichever transition has just occurred and the duration 
will alternate between about 800-900 milliseconds (for the &quot;idle&quot; part of the 
waveform) and about 100-200 milliseconds for the actual 1pps pulse.

This means that an inverter is not strictly necessary because the code is 
insensitive to polarity, but a TTL-RS232 level shifter might be a good idea 
for other reasons and will usually be an inverter also. On my system, the 
native output from my gps is a positive going 100 millisecond pulse at TTL 
level which I buffer to RS232 through a MAX233 which inverts. I am able to 
lock correctly to this negative-going pulse.

The debug output you show is one resulting from a transition at the end of the 
actual 1pps pulse. The duration is 100532 microseconds, which is reasonable 
for the 1pps pulse. It is rejected because we are interested in the 
transition which happens at the end of the &quot;idle&quot; part of the pulse. 
Hopefully, your debug output would shortly be follwed by a transition which 
produces a duration of about 900000 microseconds that would be acceptable.

However, according to your output, it might then discard this anyway as your 
cycle is not within the limits of 990000 to 1001000 microseconds. This should 
be the same duration for either direction of transition. The events HAVE to 
be every 1000000 microseconds for a good 1pps!!

As Dave C suggested, maybe your PC is a bit slow as this is only marginally 
off limits. Probably the basic waveform is really at 1000000 microseconds, 
but there is a processing delay in handling it due to debugger overheads.

As suggested, if you get ntpd to eat your output successfully when not in 
debug mode, you are on to a winner.

Hope this makes it a bit clearer.
