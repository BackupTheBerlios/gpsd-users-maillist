</I>
Is your PPS signal a regular 3V/5V TTL/CMOS output or proper RS-232 level
signal?  Some RS-232 ports will amazingly work with logic levels though
they shouldn't, strictly speaking.  Not to mention that the polarity will
be inverted too but I think GPSD can resolve the polarity problem.

I use a Garmin GPS-15H that does RS-232 on the Tx and RX lines but uses a
logic level signal for the PPS.  I massage this signal with a NOT logic
gate to invert it which then drives a MAX-232 transceiver to convert the
signal to RS-232 levels.  I thought this was the right way to do it (which
it is) and was surprised to learn people have had success with the CMOS
level driving DCD directly.  I think this point should be made in the GPSD
manual that the proper level conversion needs to be done.

See if you can adjust the pulse duty with a command and if that doesn't
work then throw an inverter and RS-232 transceiver into the fray.  I have
had trouble with GPSD not syncing to the PPS properly until I issue a
manual $PGRMI,,,,,,,R to reset the GPS15H.  I think it's fair to say that
the PPS code in GPSD needs a bit of lovin'.
