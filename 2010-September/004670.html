Thanks for that pointer. I'll look into it. My problem was that xgps was
getting good information (a good fix) and displaying it where as my Java
Client monitoring the tcp port was getting info that suggested there was
no fix. I was reading naem sentences from the tcp port and displaying
them. Perhaps I should have been using the JSON protocol.

In any case I created a good Java client that tallied with xgps by using
the DBus protocol. I just monitored the DBus signal and that is working
perfectly. I had to add the number of satellites used in a fix to the
parameters in the DBus signal as that was a requirement for the work I
was doing. That was being used as a measure of the accuracy of the fix.

Perhaps I should have posted a patch for that back to this list but I
didn't think it'd be of much use to other users? It was only a couple of
lines.
