<PRE>Greetings,
  I've been playing with GPSD's TCP NMEA data source functionality and I've
had a couple of issues. I've seen little mention of success or even
experience with the TCP NMEA data source (save
<A HREF="http://old.nabble.com/Using-TCP-data-sources-td28673333.html">http://old.nabble.com/Using-TCP-data-sources-td28673333.html</A> and
<A HREF="http://old.nabble.com/Using-TCP-data-sources-%28Round-2%29-td29251670.html">http://old.nabble.com/Using-TCP-data-sources-%28Round-2%29-td29251670.html</A>).
  I've attached a simple python server that I used to test it: it loads up a
text file with NMEA strings (captured from another GPS device) and simply
waits for a network connection. Whenever a connection is received it starts
sending the NMEA strings with a .4 second interval between them. I've also
attached a text file (gps.txt) with a couple of hundred NMEA strings.
  Please forgive any code style failures: python is my 5th language. Running
it should be a simple as copying both files to a directory and running from
a terminal (on a computer with Python installed and in the path):

python server.py gps.txt

  This spawns a server listening on localhost port 25010.

  Now for the part that doesn't work: first I start this little python
server up and leave it running.
  In another terminal I build gpsd 2.59. I run gpsd using the command line:

gpsd -b -N -n -D5 <A HREF="tcp://localhost:25010">tcp://localhost:25010</A>

  GPSD starts up, and starts spewing out the debug data.
  When I run a client connection (xgps), nothing happens. More problematic:
when I run a telnet session, and I try and run a simple version command, I
get nothing back. The TCP connection returns nothing to me. No response, no
nothing. GPSD is listening, but simply doesn't respond: I don't get the
VERSION greeting, nothing at all.
  Let me know if I'm doing something obvious, but it seems like this should
work, and right now I can't seem to make it work at all.
  Thanks,
  Femi.
