Dear GPSD Developers and Users,

due to the fact I have tested everything I could
think of to get my GPS Adapter by the company Garmin
to work and even read a lot of mailing lists, sites
and your &quot;upstream bugs&quot;, my last idea is now to tell
all what I tried to do... Here we go:

- System: Mac OS X 10.5.6 (Intel)

- Device: Garmin GPS 60 (USB/Serial) - bought 2009

- GPSD Version: Tried with 2.33, 2.38 and latest snapshot,
furthermore tried to install over Fink and compile manually
(the installation, no matter if done by Fink or manually, always
worked fine)

- Driver: Tried with pl2303, Prolific and about three others

The first thing I realized was, that no matter what driver I used
the device was not recognized, so I looked in the System Profiler
of Mac OS X and found the informations:

idVendor: 0x091e -&gt; to hex -&gt; 2334
idProduct: 0x0003 -&gt; to hex -&gt; 0003

The I went into /System/Library/Extensions and changed the
Info.plist of the pl2303 driver to match these values, finally
kextunload and kextload and AT LEAST the device made a loud BEEP...

So it was recognized by the system now. I tried the same with about
4 other drivers (also including Prolific). Neither unchanged or with
changed values it did recognize the device at any time.

I tried with reboot after every driver and every change I did, no reaction
at all.

Finally (using pl2303) I had two device /dev/cu.PL2303... and
/dev/tty.PL2303...
if I remember correctly. I tried to now connect GPSD to both of them,
without
any reaction. No data came through. I tried with Kismac-ng to get data
through GPSD or directly &quot;talking&quot; to that device. I tried several
arguments when
starting GPSD, no matter what option I used, nothing happened.

I read this is a problem connected to the select() function used by the
pl2303 driver, so I tried with other software to get data from the GPS
Adapter.
First I tried with official software provided by Garmin for Mac OS X, I got
data. Then I tried with 3rd party applications and also got data. So the
device
seems to work fine, besides those 3rd party applications seem to use their
own
drivers to load the device, at least I made a kextunload on pl2303 driver
before
starting those tools to test what happens.

Okay, this email was very long and I tried to tell everything I did the
last days
out of my mind... Hope you can help me because after 20+ hours try and
error I am
really stuck now.

Nice Greets,
Marcell 'SkyOut' Dietl
