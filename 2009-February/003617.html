<PRE>A few weeks ago I tossed a couple of (undocumented) tools out of the
gpsd codebase and issued a ukase against duplicative device-dependent
code.  Gary Miller objected that if were serious about this, sirfmon 
would have to be junked in favor of a more device-independent program
performing similar functions through the common driver level that gpsd
uses.  

This was a completely reasonable objection; in fact, such a rewrite
had been on my to-do list for a while.  I worked on it intensively 
over the President's Day weekend and can report success.

What was 'sirfmon' is now 'gpsmon' -- a general real-time packet
monitor that autodetects GPS type using the same code gpsd does.  It
uses a driver-table architecture similar to gpsd's; presently there
are driver tables for generic NMEA and SirF devices.  

There's a set of generic commands that go through driver methods -
change speed, set binary or NMEA mode (where applicable), packetize and
send specified payload to device. Each driver may also define its own
device-specific keystroke commands; for example, the SiRF has one for
toggling static-navigation mode.

I'm making noise abnout this on the list to alert our driver
naintainers.  Writing a gpsmon driver for a device that already has
a gpsd driver is dead easy, see the Generic NMEA driver in gpsmon.c
as an example.  Time to start on yours!

Remenber, gpsmon is a diagnostic rool, not a navigation client.  You
gpsmon driver should focus on displaying things (like per-sentence status
flags) that gpsd reports abstract away. 

Note: in the procvess I've also extended e driver interface, adding a
control_send() method that turns a specified payjoad into a
well-formed packet.
