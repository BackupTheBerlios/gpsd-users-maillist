<PRE>Efforts to port 3.0 to non-Linux platforms have turned up a number of small
problems with the new scons build.  We have been solving these at a rapid
clip thanks to contributions from Gleb Smirnoff, Kurt Schwehr, Bernd Zeimetz,
Dmitry Marakasov, and others.  We now have tested ports to darwin, 
and Debian/kFreebsd and I'm expecting the freebsd8 port to be confirmed
good very shortly.

We have only one new feature since 3.0: -N no longer keeps root
privileges, and it has been verified that this change plays well wuth
crony and PPS support.  The one bug on the tracker when 3.0 shipped
has been confirmed fixed by the submitter.

I have also added pychecker testing of our Python code to our sanity
checks. Coverage is not yet complete but I'm moving in that direction.

I'm thinking I want to do a rapid 3.1 release to get these port fixes
out to the distributions.  As so little code has changed since release
(the -N changes were almost trivial and confined to an early
initialization stage) and PPS/chrony operation has been verified, I consider
us not to have dropped out of state 3 (green) since 3.0.  

Providing Dmitry Marakasov confirms that the freebsd8 port fixes are
sufficient, I'll call freeze for 3.1 release in about 48 hours.  No new
features, please, and urgent bugfixes only.

Finally, I should note that I think everyone involved with this
project deserves to feel proud of what we have accomplished.  The long
period of code stability leading up to 3.0, the state of the tracker,
and the nature of the fix patches that have come in since release all
confirm to me that we have maintained a level of quality and a
rapidity of response to problems that most projects would find
enviable.
