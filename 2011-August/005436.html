In post processing (I'm time-tagging sensor data, not a real problem to adjust the time stamps later) I can then correct for the time offsets, after outlier detection and filtering of the offset values.

Please post your findings. I am starting the exact same thing. In a
vehicle without internet I want to have the PC time set, as close as
possible, to the current GPS time. Other devices I have do the same.

Currently I compute the difference between PC and GPS time, using the
PPS signal and the ZDA record in my own C code. I too want to drop that
in favor of gpsd.

The thing I have been worrying about is if the systems are started when
there is no GPS available, like in a garage. Then, I would imagine the
time is whatever the GPS receiver maintained. When the satellites come
in to view, this may change. How quickly is that seen in the PC time? I
do not mean how quickly it is seen from the GPS. I mean from when the
GPS starts reporting it until the PC clock is completely adjusted. I am
guessing that this initial time difference will be small. But whatever
it may be, I need to know how the change is introduced into the system.


Yours sincerely,
