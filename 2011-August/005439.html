</I>&gt;<i> Please post your findings. I am starting the exact same thing. In a

</I>
So far the NovAtel + gpsd + chrony setup seems to work pretty good. I've tested it only in the lab, and with many reboots, but not yet with long power-offs.  I have to dive a little bit deeper in the chrony config to see what the best options are for that.

&gt;<i> Currently I compute the difference between PC and GPS time, using the
</I>&gt;<i> PPS signal and the ZDA record in my own C code. I too want to drop that
</I>&gt;<i> in favor of gpsd.
</I>
What I really like of the gpsd - chrony combi is that I can log the offsets between 1PPS and PC time so I can correct things later if I want.

&gt;<i> The thing I have been worrying about is if the systems are started when
</I>&gt;<i> there is no GPS available, like in a garage. Then, I would imagine the
</I>&gt;<i> time is whatever the GPS receiver maintained. When the satellites come
</I>&gt;<i> in to view, this may change. How quickly is that seen in the PC time? I
</I>&gt;<i> do not mean how quickly it is seen from the GPS. I mean from when the
</I>&gt;<i> GPS starts reporting it until the PC clock is completely adjusted. I am
</I>&gt;<i> guessing that this initial time difference will be small. But whatever
</I>&gt;<i> it may be, I need to know how the change is introduced into the system.
</I>
That's why I switched to chrony, ntpd sucks in this context. 
I have to do more testing to get you numbers, but from what I've seen is that the PC clock is adjusted (&lt;1ms) in 10s of seconds.

For my current application I need sub-ms, and that seems very achievable. For other applications I would like to push it quite a bit further (I'm rather interested how far it can be pushed without dedicated hardware such as a ptp server and ptp-ready NICs)

We're also building a robotic platform (quad rotor) with a sensor payload that needs to be time-synchronized. I'm opting for that one to not use GPS as the common standard, since we want to be able to operate this thing in gps-denied scenarios. So I'm thinking about a reference oscillator and a time pulse that is used as the common time source to time-tag all sensors (some connected to FPGAs, some to a PC). If GPS is available, we'll determine the relation between the reference time and GPS time. It's probably easiest if the reference clock remains somewhat close to UTC so we can sync the PC to that using a gpsd-chrony combination

I'll keep you posted on the topic,

Wouter
