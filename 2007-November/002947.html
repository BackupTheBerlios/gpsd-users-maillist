I have glib.h on my system and the comments indicate it's part of GLib.
The docs say &quot;GLib is a library containing many useful C routines for
things such as trees, hashes, lists, and strings.  It is a useful
general-purpose C library used by projects such as GTK+, GIMP, and
GNOME.&quot;

I don't know if FreeBSD does this, but on Linux it's fairly common for
libraries to have a main package (like &quot;libfoo&quot;) and a development
package (like &quot;libfoo-dev&quot;).  The main package contains only the
libraries, and is useful for precompiled software that just needs to
link against the libraries.  The development package contains the
headers that are needed to compile software that uses the library from
source code.  You may need to install the GLib development package in
order to get gpxlogger.c to compile.

&gt;<i> gpxlogger.c:9:23: dbus/dbus.h: No such file or directory
</I>
Same story with dbus.h .  The docs say &quot;D-Bus is a message bus, used
for sending messages between applications.  Conceptually, it fits
somewhere in between raw sockets and CORBA in terms of complexity.&quot;
There is a dbus package, plus a dbus-glib package that says &quot;This
package provides the GLib-based shared library for applications
using the GLib interface to D-Bus.&quot;  You may need to install the DBus
and DBus-GLib development packages in order to get gpxlogger.c to
compile.

Another option, at least for dbus.h, would be to tell the build process
to not look for DBus at all.  It's been a while since I built something
on FreeBSD, but if you still get to run &quot;configure&quot; yourself, you might
say

configure --disable-dbus

and it shouldn't even try to build the stuff that needs DBus.  Note that
the --disable-dbus option os from the configure shipped with gpsd-2.34 ;
I don't know if it was in gpsd-2.32 or not.

I hope this helps!
