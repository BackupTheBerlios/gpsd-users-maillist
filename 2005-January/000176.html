I assume, though, that it still works fine with current gpsd, and any 
upgrading for newer grass should not be a big deal either.

</I>
In this regard the grass solution is more complete than xastir, whicch 
currently supports OGR but not GDAL (though for the asker, who wants 
vector, there is no difference)

&gt;<i> FYI something else which doesn't cover the real-time nature of gpsd you

</I>&gt;<i> gpstrans + GRASS GIS 5.7 = v.in.garmin module. I'm planning on one day
</I>&gt;<i> updating this to talk to gpsbabel as well..
</I>
I have a Magellan and a cheesy awk(!) script to do it. I suppose I should 
look at gpsbabel.

&gt;&gt;<i> about all it doesn't support is route-finding; aside from tmrs (which
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> has very limited route finding in the code and isn't useful generally
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> yet) i know of no open source program which does.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You would probably just have to write the glue to interface my realtime
</I>&gt;<i> GIS cludge with GRASS 5.7's vector path modules[*]: d.path, v.net.path,
</I>&gt;<i> &amp;/or v.net.salesman.
</I>
I'll have to look at those. tmrs has the &quot;self contained&quot; advantage, 
meaning I could port it to my car stereo, with a minimal simple 2 bit 
depth display (128x32) and only a low-end CPU.
