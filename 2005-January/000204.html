<PRE>Tilman Koschnick &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-users">til at subnetz.org</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> As for the timestamp, I'm using the utc member of the gps_data_t
</I>&gt;<i> structure, so it is ISO8601 format. I will add specifiers for the single
</I>&gt;<i> components of the time stamp, so that people can make their own format.
</I>
That's why I asked. If you add such specifiers, please be compatible
with strftime(3).  That leaves you %f, %L,  %N, %o, %q, %Q, %v unassigned.

       %a     The abbreviated weekday name according to the current locale.

       %A     The full weekday name according to the current locale.

       %b     The abbreviated month name according to the current locale.

       %B     The full month name according to the current locale.

       %c     The  preferred  date  and  time  representation for the current
              locale.

       %C     The century number (year/100) as a 2-digit integer. (SU)

       %d     The day of the month as a decimal number (range 01 to 31).

       %D     Equivalent to %m/%d/%y. (Yecch - for Americans only.  Americans
              should  note that in other countries %d/%m/%y is rather common.
              This means that in international context this format is ambigu-
              ous and should not be used.) (SU)

       %e     Like  %d, the day of the month as a decimal number, but a lead-
              ing zero is replaced by a space. (SU)

       %E     Modifier: use alternative format, see below. (SU)

       %F     Equivalent to %Y-%m-%d (the ISO 8601 date format). (C99)

       %G     The ISO 8601 year  with  century  as  a  decimal  number.   The
              4-digit  year  corresponding  to  the ISO week number (see %V).
              This has the same format and value as %y, except  that  if  the
              ISO week number belongs to the previous or next year, that year
              is used instead. (TZ)

       %g     Like %G,  but  without  century,  i.e.,  with  a  2-digit  year
              (00-99). (TZ)

       %h     Equivalent to %b. (SU)

       %H     The hour as a decimal number using a 24-hour clock (range 00 to
              23).

       %I     The hour as a decimal number using a 12-hour clock (range 01 to
              12).

       %j     The day of the year as a decimal number (range 001 to 366).

       %k     The  hour  (24-hour clock) as a decimal number (range 0 to 23);
              single digits are preceded by a blank. (See also %H.) (TZ)

       %l     The hour (12-hour clock) as a decimal number (range 1  to  12);
              single digits are preceded by a blank. (See also %I.) (TZ)

       %m     The month as a decimal number (range 01 to 12).

       %M     The minute as a decimal number (range 00 to 59).

       %n     A newline character. (SU)

       %O     Modifier: use alternative format, see below. (SU)

       %p     Either  &#8216;AM&#8217;  or &#8216;PM&#8217; according to the given time value, or the
              corresponding strings for the current locale.  Noon is  treated
              as &#8216;pm&#8217; and midnight as &#8216;am&#8217;.

       %P     Like  %p  but  in  lowercase:  &#8216;am&#8217;  or &#8216;pm&#8217; or a corresponding
              string for the current locale. (GNU)

       %r     The time in a.m. or p.m. notation.  In the POSIX locale this is
              equivalent to &#8216;%I:%M:%S %p&#8217;. (SU)

       %R     The  time  in  24-hour  notation  (%H:%M).  (SU)  For a version
              including the seconds, see %T below.

       %s     The number of seconds since the Epoch, i.e.,  since  1970-01-01
              00:00:00 UTC. (TZ)

       %S     The second as a decimal number (range 00 to 61).

       %t     A tab character. (SU)

       %T     The time in 24-hour notation (%H:%M:%S). (SU)

       %u     The day of the week as a decimal, range 1 to 7, Monday being 1.
              See also %w. (SU)

       %U     The week number of the current year as a decimal number,  range
              00  to  53,  starting with the first Sunday as the first day of
              week 01. See also %V and %W.

       %V     The ISO 8601:1988 week number of the current year as a  decimal
              number, range 01 to 53, where week 1 is the first week that has
              at least 4 days in the current year, and  with  Monday  as  the
              first day of the week. See also %U and %W. (SU)

       %w     The day of the week as a decimal, range 0 to 6, Sunday being 0.
              See also %u.

       %W     The week number of the current year as a decimal number,  range
              00  to  53,  starting with the first Monday as the first day of
              week 01.

       %x     The preferred date representation for the current locale  with-
              out the time.

       %X     The  preferred time representation for the current locale with-
              out the date.

       %y     The year as a decimal number without a  century  (range  00  to
              99).

       %Y     The year as a decimal number including the century.

       %z     The  time-zone  as  hour  offset  from  GMT.   Required to emit
              RFC822-conformant dates (using &quot;%a, %d  %b  %Y  %H:%M:%S  %z&quot;).
              (GNU)

       %Z     The time zone or name or abbreviation.
