<PRE>[heading off topic, but maybe of interest to others]

&gt;&gt;<i> That's probably the most straight forward solution but if you are 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> into some functionality overkill you could also try my real-time 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> plugin for GRASS GIS; although a bit clunky and based on old
</I>versions
&gt;&gt;<i> (GPSD 1.1 and GRASS 5.0), it takes care of the task it was written 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for nicely.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I assume, though, that it still works fine with current gpsd, and 
</I>&gt;<i> any upgrading for newer grass should not be a big deal either.
</I>
Um, no on both counts. I used a patched gpsd 1.10 I think and tried in
November to run it with the latest gpsd. It didn't work first time
around so I used the older version which did work. With some minor
tweaks I'm sure it could work but I was at sea at the time and just
wanted something that worked. My C code for talking to gpsd is a bit
patched together so if there is a problem I think it would be with my
code.....

re. GRASS, it requires GRASS versions 5.0-5.4, as the site-point system
was changed from a straight ascii file into a feature type in the
topological vector engine for versions 5.7+. GRASS 5.7+ ascii vector
files are pretty easy to write to (just 'echo &quot;P x y&quot; &gt;&gt; file.asc' or
so) but you have to reimport to binary the ascii file with every new
fix.. actually I could just add the point to a DBF database or into the
GRASS vector file at each fix but I still think I'd have to rebuild
topology at each step.. So: could work but 5.4.0 is the current stable
version of GRASS &amp; the implimentation is a bit cleaner so I'm not
working on it yet. 5.4 has a new build mechanism vs 5.0 &amp; I haven't
updated the m.realtime_gps distribution with a new Makefile and
instructions for that yet (but it works).


&gt;&gt;<i> You get support for all raster/vector map formats supported by 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> GDAL/OGR (which is most):
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  <A HREF="http://gdal.org/">http://gdal.org/</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  <A HREF="http://gdal.org/ogr/">http://gdal.org/ogr/</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In this regard the grass solution is more complete than xastir, which
</I>&gt;<i> currently supports OGR but not GDAL (though for the asker, who wants 
</I>&gt;<i> vector, there is no difference)
</I>
for clarity &amp; the record, OGR comes as part of the GDAL distribution;
GDAL covers raster formats (GeoTIFFs, USGS binary DEMs, etc) while OGR
does the same thing for vector formats (US census TIGER, ESRI shape
files, etc). Rasters tend to take up more resources..


&gt;&gt;<i> FYI something else which doesn't cover the real-time nature of gpsd 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> you are probably thinking of; typical use with the GIS is
</I>downloading
&gt;&gt;<i> the waypoints and tracks at the end of the day. This is very easy 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with gpstrans + GRASS GIS 5.7 = v.in.garmin module. I'm planning on 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> one day updating this to talk to gpsbabel as well..
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have a Magellan and a cheesy awk(!) script to do it. I suppose I 
</I>&gt;<i> should look at gpsbabel.
</I>
for clarity &amp; the record, gpsbabel talks to a whole lot of brands of
GPSs and GPS softwares' file formats and downloads &amp; translates them.
v.in.garmin is a nice little GRASS script which will use gpstrans to
connect to a Garmin unit, download waypoints, tracks, and routes; load
them into the GIS including labels timestampts etc features; and
transform coordinates into the current map projection/datum.


&gt;<i> meaning I could port it to my car stereo, with a minimal simple 2 bit
</I>
&gt;<i> depth display (128x32) and only a low-end CPU.
</I>
via mini-itx + the travla casetronic 137(?) rocks.

GRASS was written by the US Govt starting in about 1983..it runs on
really low end hardware (mostly in text mode)[*]. I've run it on a
2-bit NCD thin terminal without any problems. but that was under NCD's
X. There is only so much you can do with 128x32.  time, loc'n, speed,
direction, &amp; status text I guess.

[*] historical footnote: apparently william shatner once did a video
promo for GRASS in the mid to late 80s for Goddard SFC. now you know.
