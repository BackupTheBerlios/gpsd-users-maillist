<PRE>tz &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-users">thomas at mich.com</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> I have three things, mostly my tasks:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1. NO_FLOAT
</I>
That's a big one. We'll probably go through a couple of release cycles
shaking it down.

Which reminds me.  We had another ARM guy show up on IRC reporting
a horrible performance problem on an arm9.  He had gpsd eating half
the processor.

After some profiling and microtuning, it looked like the remaining problem 
was expensive float instructions.  I thought of you, of course. But!
It turned out he had unintentionally disabled an instruction-caching feature.
When he undid that, gpsd's processor usage dropped down to accasional 1% 
spikes but mostly too low to make it out of statistical noise.

Accordingly, I think you need to check your assumption that float
instructions are a serious performance problem more carefully. Because
now I've actually seen ARM profile results that looked that way but
were masking a different problem.

Not that I'm not saying this to avoid doing NOFLOAT; I think it will
be a good idea on general principles. But we should be proceeding on
a basis of reality.  If there's a misdiagnosis here, now is the time
to figure that out.

&gt;<i> 2. GLONASS support, at least the Venus NMEA strings unless another
</I>&gt;<i> chipset comes out that does glonass.
</I>
If you're just talking about writing an NMEA-variant a driver for the Venus,
that's not a large change and wouldn't destabilize core code.  I might be
willing to take that before 3.0.

&gt;<i> 3. NMEA sentence aggregation fixes
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> (together they will require the master structure to change and
</I>&gt;<i> driver_nmea to be rewritten).
</I>
Defintely post-3.0.

&gt;<i> I also posted some garmin NMEA 5Hz midnight rollover problem logs to
</I>&gt;<i> the list a few weeks ago.  Those should probably be added to the
</I>&gt;<i> regression test.
</I>
Ah, is that what they were? I've been meaning to ask.  They didn't seem
annotated with information on what they were demonstrating.
