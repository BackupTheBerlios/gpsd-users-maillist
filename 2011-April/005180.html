<!--beginarticle-->
<PRE>When we shipped 2.96, I expressed the intention that the next release
cycle to 3.0 would be a short one.  Personally, I had two goals for
this cycle: (1) build a working shared-memory export, and (2) migrate
the build system off autotools. The first one is achieved, and the
second one nearly so - only building the Qt binding remains to be solved
and we have two devs actively working that problem.

For those of you who haven't been following it, by the way, the scons
conversion has gone so smoothly it's almost ridiculous.  Discussion
here: &lt;<A HREF="http://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=3089">http://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=3089</A>&gt;.  I am *extremely* pleased with
the result, both in terms of the expected effect on long-term
maintainance burden and the actual performance of the build.

More good news: We've barely disturbed the core code at all.  I made
one moderately intrusive change to revert the client and daemon to using
the same set of status-flag masks; this was to support the shared-memory
interface, which will actually expose the daemon-side flags.  I ripped 
out a bunch of gps_maskdump() calls for performance reasons.  I glued
about 60 lines of code into daemon and client for the shared-memory
export, and then refactored the client code. And that is about it!

I think now is a good time to begin planning for the 3.0 release. The
bugtracker is nearly empty, the core code is in good shape, the 
API cleanup is done, and we have a manageably small number of cleanup
and finishing tasks still pending.  Here's how I prioritize them:

-------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Test, test, test.  I'd like 3.0 to be bulletproof even by our
historical standards, which aren't low.  Bernd Zeimetz, I'd like your
help in getting flocktest to play nice with the Debian test farm so we
can qualify GPSD on a bunch of non-x86 architectures. You and I need to
hammer at this together via IRC; fortunately it's unlikely to take
long.

2. Finish the build-system conversion to scons.  Jon Schleuter and Bernd
Zeimetz are on top of this one.

3. Sweet-talk Coverity into running another code analysis and fix any 
reports that generates.  This is my job.

4. We have a longstanding bug that mode-change doesn't work on UBX.
This one is Chris Kuethe's to fix.

5. (Tracker bug #17800) ntpshm more than four.  Gary Miller owns the ntpshm
code. We should dispose of this feature request either with implementation
or a reasoned decision not to do it.

6. (Tracker bug #18003) Python path setting.  This one's mine.

7. Make subframe reports available in the C API.  This one is Gary Miller's.

Past this point we get into &quot;it would be nice&quot; items.  These are things
that can wait until 3.1 but can be pursued opportunistically before 3.0
without destabilizing the code.

8. Use Dirk Stocker's test pairs to debug and verify the RTCM3 analyzer.
This one's mine.

9. Reporting code for specialized Type 6 and 8 AIS messages.  Mine and
Kurt Schwehr's.  Kurt: I still need Area Notice and Environmental
descriptions merged into AIVDM.txt before I can complete this.

10. Finish and test the TNT Revolution driver.  This one is mine and 
Jon Schleuter's.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

My major question is: What if anything is missing from this list? 
Are there any urgent bugs I don't know about?  Easy feature requests?
What else, if anything, should  we be planning for 3.0?

I'd also like to hear time estimates on these tasks from the people 
who own them.
