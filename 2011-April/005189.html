<PRE>I'm reviving an old project of mine - the travelcam.  It's a webcam that 
takes a picture of the road every so often.  It sounds simple but it's 
been difficult to implement on a platform that uses minimal power... 
Anyway, I finally have the hardware set up and running; now I need to 
get gpsd into the act.

The travelcam should only take pictures when the vehicle is moving; 
further, it should only take pictures after the vehicle has moved some 
arbitrary distance.  So, for example, the user can set it up to say,  
take pictures no more than every 15 minutes and no closer than 5 miles 
apart.

Since I started working on this, gpsd has ditched its old interface and 
moved forward with JSON.  I'm a total newb to JSON and I'm struggling to 
find examples of how to use it from a shell script.  In fact, I'm 
struggling to find any newb-level examples at all.

Everything seems to assume that you know JSON already and just need 
details of implementation.

Can someone provide a few basic, basic examples of building a query and 
parsing the response in a shell script?
