<PRE>We now have a working and almost complete scons build recipe. I plan
this to replace the autotools-based build system, probably in 3.0 and
certainly in 3.1.  Please test - especially those of you with unusual
platforms and compilers.

Advantages: Much more maintainable. Blazingly fast
Disadvantages:  Can't yet build the Qt client binding. No VPATH support,

About maintainability, the line counts tell the story:

  1024 SConstruct

  1029 configure.ac
   957 Makefile.am
  9309 aclocal.m4
  1693 config.sub
  1533 config.guess
 14521 total

The Python in SConstruct is a good deal more readable than the contents
of configure.ac and Makefile.am, so the line counts understate the advantages
of scons a bit.

As for speed, here are times from my 2MHz Untel Core Duo:

autotools:
real	0m45.986s
user	0m44.120s
sys	0m6.210s

scons:
real	0m17.194s
user	0m15.490s
sys	0m2.360s

That 66% drop is particularly impressive in view of the fact that scons
is a one-phase system - does its equivalent of autotools configure every
time.

There is no problem in principle with the Qt client binding - the only
reason that isn't working is I don't understand the particularly convoluted
autotools quicksand around it.

Out-of-directory builds are a thornier issue. Something functionally like a
VPATH build is supposed to be possible under scons, but the conceptual
model is quite different: see <A HREF="http://www.scons.org/wiki/UsingBuildDir">http://www.scons.org/wiki/UsingBuildDir</A> 
for discussion. 

I have, however, carefully preserved all the instances of $(srcdir)
from Makefile.am, in case that's useful; they're now $SRCDIR in the
scons recipe and it's just set to '.'.

Somebody who groks VPATH builds will have to dive in and do the right
thing using the VariantDir() and Repository() features of SCons.  It
won't be me; I've never had any requirement for VPATH builds myself,
so I don't have a good feel for the problems.
