<PRE>I am considering if I want to use GPSD to maintain accurate time in a
measurement system that we build. The relevant system characteristics
are that:

 * the system is in a vehicle that travels on roads.

 * the computer will not be connected to the internet.

 * the vehicle may occasionally be located in a building, and then
unable to access the sky. This is especially true when the system is
initially powered on.

 * being in the real world, the satellite signals may degrade from time
to time. For example, when driving on a road bound by tall trees, or in
urban canyons. We do have an INS that helps with our locations during
these times. But I do not know how time is effected.

 * the GPS receivers are rather high quality survey-grade devices from
Trimble. The PPS signal is available.

I guess I am trying to figure out the dynamics of such a system. For
example, if the system is powered on when there are no satellites
available, how long after they become available would one expect that
the system time may be correct? How long might one be without GPS
signals before time is effected? What other questions should I be asking
here?

I am sure there are more important questions I should be asking. I
realize that these are very system-dependent questions, and so any
answers may not apply in my case. I am really just curious if there are
any others here who are using gpsd for a similar use. If so, what sort
of issues have they encountered, and have they found solutions.






Yours sincerely,
