R&gt; I am considering if I want to use GPSD to maintain accurate time in a
R&gt; measurement system that we build. The relevant system characteristics
R&gt; are that:
R&gt; 
R&gt;  * the system is in a vehicle that travels on roads.
R&gt; 
R&gt;  * the computer will not be connected to the internet.
R&gt; 
R&gt;  * the vehicle may occasionally be located in a building, and then
R&gt; unable to access the sky. This is especially true when the system is
R&gt; initially powered on.
R&gt; 
R&gt;  * being in the real world, the satellite signals may degrade from time
R&gt; to time. For example, when driving on a road bound by tall trees, or in
R&gt; urban canyons. We do have an INS that helps with our locations during
R&gt; these times. But I do not know how time is effected.
R&gt; 
R&gt;  * the GPS receivers are rather high quality survey-grade devices from
R&gt; Trimble. The PPS signal is available.
R&gt; 
R&gt; I guess I am trying to figure out the dynamics of such a system. For
R&gt; example, if the system is powered on when there are no satellites
R&gt; available, how long after they become available would one expect that
R&gt; the system time may be correct? How long might one be without GPS
R&gt; signals before time is effected? What other questions should I be asking
R&gt; here?
R&gt; 
R&gt; I am sure there are more important questions I should be asking. I
R&gt; realize that these are very system-dependent questions, and so any
R&gt; answers may not apply in my case. I am really just curious if there are
R&gt; any others here who are using gpsd for a similar use. If so, what sort
R&gt; of issues have they encountered, and have they found solutions.

I am using GPSD in car. I'm not interested in nano-second precision, so
I have USB receiver, and I use NTP shared memory segment for
synchronisation.

Answer to all your &quot;how long ...?&quot; questions is &quot;time varies depending
on conditions&quot;. :) However, if car is outside of building it usually
takes less than minute.
