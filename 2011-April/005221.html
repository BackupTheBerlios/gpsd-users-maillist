<PRE>2011/4/18 Roger Oberholtzer &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-users">roger.oberholtzer at ramboll.se</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> I am considering if I want to use GPSD to maintain accurate time in a
</I>&gt;<i> measurement system that we build. The relevant system characteristics
</I>&gt;<i> are that:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;* the system is in a vehicle that travels on roads.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;* the computer will not be connected to the internet.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;* the vehicle may occasionally be located in a building, and then
</I>&gt;<i> unable to access the sky. This is especially true when the system is
</I>&gt;<i> initially powered on.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;* being in the real world, the satellite signals may degrade from time
</I>&gt;<i> to time. For example, when driving on a road bound by tall trees, or in
</I>&gt;<i> urban canyons. We do have an INS that helps with our locations during
</I>&gt;<i> these times. But I do not know how time is effected.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;* the GPS receivers are rather high quality survey-grade devices from
</I>&gt;<i> Trimble. The PPS signal is available.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I guess I am trying to figure out the dynamics of such a system. For
</I>&gt;<i> example, if the system is powered on when there are no satellites
</I>&gt;<i> available, how long after they become available would one expect that
</I>&gt;<i> the system time may be correct? How long might one be without GPS
</I>&gt;<i> signals before time is effected? What other questions should I be asking
</I>&gt;<i> here?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am sure there are more important questions I should be asking. I
</I>&gt;<i> realize that these are very system-dependent questions, and so any
</I>&gt;<i> answers may not apply in my case. I am really just curious if there are
</I>&gt;<i> any others here who are using gpsd for a similar use. If so, what sort
</I>&gt;<i> of issues have they encountered, and have they found solutions.
</I>
Just to make sure you are aware of it, for this type of application
gpsd + chrony seems to be a preferred over ntpd.  Chrony was build
with intermittent timesource availably in mind.  This is from multiple email
 list threads which have mitigated towards this solution in the past.
