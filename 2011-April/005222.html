Indeed - I was just about to add the same.  Also chrony has a bunch of
features allowing it to jump or slew very quickly to the new time.

The main thing you should consider though is some kind of battery backed
RTC clock on your device?  This way the device will boot up with a time
which is at least vaguely in the correct vicinity?  Chrony can take over
from there

A real hack is to occasionally touch some file, then on boot set the
clock to the mtime of that file.  The clock is now always in the past,
but at least you can now slew forwards from there, and log files, etc
are monotonic increasing (if not correct).  Gentoo supports this with
it's boot scripts, nasty, but can be better than nothing...

Oh, Chrony will discipline both your RTC clock and the device clock.
This roughly means that if you have an RTC on your device, the device is
turned off for a month, then not only will chrony grab the time from the
RTC at boot, but it will also try and offset that clock based on it's
measured drift rate.  OK, it's not going to be that accurate, but its an
incremental improvement over nothing (usually)

Note that a new Chrony will be released very imminently - I would
recommend going with a tarball from git if you don't mind building your
own package

Good luck
