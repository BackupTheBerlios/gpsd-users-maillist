 &gt; 
 &gt; Then I don't understand your bug scenario.  If you set the port to 2317 bad,
 &gt; then gpsd closed the port because there were no clients, then gpsd reopened 
 &gt; it later, gpsd should simply have continued reading bytes at that speed.

i used the 'b' command to set a baud rate that my device _did_
support (1200?  300?  i was idly investigating whether my 15
second latency issues were affected by baud rate).  as i recall,
gpsd continued to be able to talk to the device, though i can't
be sure of that.  then, when i terminated gpsd -- and, now that
i think of, possibly removed/inserted the USB receiver (i think
that would reset the baud rate to default), gpsd could no longer
find it.

 &gt; &gt; in general i don't modify code needlessly.  gpsd wouldn't find my
 &gt; &gt; device because my device was running at a speed not in the hunt
 &gt; &gt; loop.  how would &quot;preserve previous baud rate&quot; help there?
 &gt; 
 &gt; It wouldn't. You're making a pretty good argument that I should remove
 &gt; bspeed changes from the command set, or at least make them a privileged 
 &gt; command that can only be sent over the control port.

perhaps.  or don't allow setting a rate that's not supported in the
hunt list.
