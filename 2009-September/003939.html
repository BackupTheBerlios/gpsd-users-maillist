<PRE>Paul Fox &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-users">pgf at foxharp.boston.ma.us</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> sorry, i certainly wasn't clear.  it's the behavior of preserving
</I>&gt;<i> the current baud rate across a device close/open which i believe is
</I>&gt;<i> a linux-ism.  at least, it was definitely a change from unix tty
</I>&gt;<i> behavior that i first observed in linux -- perhaps it's customary
</I>&gt;<i> behavior everywhere (or perhaps even specified by posix) now.  i've
</I>&gt;<i> never viewed it as more than a convenience before this.
</I>
This can be checked; we have developers running under OpenBSD and MacOS X.
Can anyone report whether baud rate is preserved across device closes on these
systems?  

&gt;<i>  &gt; So, what you've described isn't even a bug.  You hacked the code to fix
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; your &quot;problem&quot; before you realized that gpsd would cheerfully
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; reconnect to the device and *just work*.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> if it it had &quot;just worked&quot;, i wouldn't have had to hack.
</I>
Then I don't understand your bug scenario.  If you set the port to 2317 bad,
then gpsd closed the port because there were no clients, then gpsd reopened 
it later, gpsd should simply have continued reading bytes at that speed.

&gt;<i> in general i don't modify code needlessly.  gpsd wouldn't find my
</I>&gt;<i> device because my device was running at a speed not in the hunt
</I>&gt;<i> loop.  how would &quot;preserve previous baud rate&quot; help there?
</I>
It wouldn't. You're making a pretty good argument that I should remove
bspeed changes from the command set, or at least make them a privileged 
command that can only be sent over the control port.

&gt;<i>  &gt; I love the Unix culture.  But this particular &quot;tradition&quot; (bolting on
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; configuration options as a substitute for autoconfiguration) should die
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; a swift and horrible death. It's not gpsd that is defective here, it's
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; your habits of thought.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> please.  lose the condescension.
</I>
I'll lose the &quot;condescension&quot; within ten seconds of when Unix programmers
as a culture get a clue about autoconfiguration.  And *not before then*.
