<PRE>Ed W &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-users">lists at wildgooses.com</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> Actually, I will show you a conversation which will allow us to very  
</I>&gt;<i> reliably detect a modem.  If you look at my pseudo code before I pointed  
</I>&gt;<i> out that I agreed that a single &quot;OK&quot; response to a single &quot;AT&quot; question  
</I>&gt;<i> was just the starting point.  If you then munch data for a while to  
</I>&gt;<i> clear down any input then if it doesn't stop then we should abort  
</I>&gt;<i> because it's not a modem.  If it does go quiet then you simply repeat  
</I>&gt;<i> the AT, get an OK response a few times to be sure it's a modem.  And  
</I>&gt;<i> then I would personally ask the modem a few other AT commands which  
</I>&gt;<i> generate slightly different responses to get a bit more detail about  
</I>&gt;<i> make/model
</I>
But getting make/model is *well* outside gpsd's remit.

&gt;<i> I really think there is very, very little chance of false positives  
</I>&gt;<i> here.  However, the point is to do slightly more than just sending an  
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;AT&quot; and assuming if we get a single &quot;OK&quot; back then it must be a modem.   
</I>&gt;<i> I'm sure the same logic actually extends to testing most of the GPS  
</I>&gt;<i> devices though?
</I>
No.  The packet-sniffer doesn't actually send any probes at all, and
does *much* more careful pattern-matching that relies on checksums.

&gt;&gt;<i> You probably need to be talking to the udev or DeviceKit folks, then.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Perhaps - however, I think udev simply gives us the means to spot that  
</I>&gt;<i> the hardware is connected.  Probing it seems like a userspace problem to  
</I>&gt;<i> me.
</I>
Yes.  DeviceKit (formerly hald) is the userspace part.

&gt;<i> Sure - but I guess you hit those because between them they dominate the  
</I>&gt;<i> observed market?
</I>
The GPS market.  We don't know about other device classes.

&gt;<i> In the same way, the remaining small number of serial devices is  
</I>&gt;<i> probably then dominated by modems.
</I>
I doubt it.  Consider UPSes with USB monitoring ports.  I have three of
those in my house and no modems.

&gt;<i> Yep - spot on.  I was hoping to
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> a) &quot;borrow&quot; the central gpsd device detection loop and as a result all  
</I>&gt;<i> the packet sniffing stuff
</I>
Go right ahead.  The interface to the low-level library is pretty
well documented; look at libgpsd.xml.
