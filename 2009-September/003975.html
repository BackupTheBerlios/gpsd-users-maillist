<PRE>Hi

&gt;<i> Not normally, no.  But remember the hunt loop.  Every time we change parameters 
</I>&gt;<i> we're likely to get a bunch of baud barf as the UART resettles. The failure mode
</I>&gt;<i> I'm worried about is this: we change settings, random garbage starts coming 
</I>&gt;<i> in, we ship &quot;AT&quot;, and oops!  That OK was baud barf, not an actual response.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>
Actually, I will show you a conversation which will allow us to very 
reliably detect a modem.  If you look at my pseudo code before I pointed 
out that I agreed that a single &quot;OK&quot; response to a single &quot;AT&quot; question 
was just the starting point.  If you then munch data for a while to 
clear down any input then if it doesn't stop then we should abort 
because it's not a modem.  If it does go quiet then you simply repeat 
the AT, get an OK response a few times to be sure it's a modem.  And 
then I would personally ask the modem a few other AT commands which 
generate slightly different responses to get a bit more detail about 
make/model

I really think there is very, very little chance of false positives 
here.  However, the point is to do slightly more than just sending an 
&quot;AT&quot; and assuming if we get a single &quot;OK&quot; back then it must be a modem.  
I'm sure the same logic actually extends to testing most of the GPS 
devices though?


&gt;&gt;<i>                     I really need a more generic approach to handling 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the hotplug event and figuring out which subsystem should be fired up in 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> response to a serial port connection event
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You probably need to be talking to the udev or DeviceKit folks, then.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>
Perhaps - however, I think udev simply gives us the means to spot that 
the hardware is connected.  Probing it seems like a userspace problem to 
me.

Remember this is what USB is designed to solve - detecting a device and 
getting the device to cooperate with that.  The situation here is being 
stuck with a bunch of serial devices which obviously doesn't lend itself 
easily to plug'n'play.


&gt;&gt;<i> Why am I posting here?  Basically because there is already a great 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> autodetection in gpsd for a wide class of serial connected devices and 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with a bit of open-mindedness I hope people can see that it might be 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> useful to re-use the autodetection part of gpsd for a wider purpose....
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Actually, we handle a very *narrow* class of devices - eight specific 
</I>&gt;<i> USB-to-serial chips and that's it.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>
Sure - but I guess you hit those because between them they dominate the 
observed market?

In the same way, the remaining small number of serial devices is 
probably then dominated by modems.  At this stage I was only going to 
try and pick those off with a generic detection and leave detecting 
serial port connected fridges as a todo item...


&gt;<i> There's a timeout. Maybe you didn't wait long enough for it.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>
Aha - probably that's it

However, this gets me no further to solving my goal.  I have a serial 
port - it's either a gps or a modem - I need to do something with it 
once I know which it is... 

&gt;<i> The packet sniffer, maybe.  None of the rest of it.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>
Yep - spot on.  I was hoping to

a) &quot;borrow&quot; the central gpsd device detection loop and as a result all 
the packet sniffing stuff
b) make it available as a separate utility to udev (why? because right 
now my 5MB embedded device needs to gain a 10MB python dependency simply 
for the sake of a 20 line udev script. Coding this in C and making it 
smarter would eliminate a lot of baggage in my situation)



I don't think this is seriously silly stuff though.  Probably these days 
serial ports are dominated by gps style devices.  Modems are probably a 
smaller percentage, but the next most common (especially I should think 
detecting the difference between bluetooth phone connections and 
bluetooth gps devices? untested question though?).  Everything below 
that is probably increasingly rare, eg I would imagine that for desktops 
then UPS's were the next most common use, but for my marine users, its 
probably AIS receivers and HF radios.
