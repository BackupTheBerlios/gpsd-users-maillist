&quot;OK&quot; will turn randomly from time to time I'm sure, but the point with a 
modem is that it *doesn't* send an OK unless you probe it in some way.  
If an OK is turning up at all in gpsd scanning then actually you could 
flip it on it's head and say it's even less likely to be a modem...

Counterpoint though - if it *is* a modem then it says &quot;OK\r&quot; near 
instantly every time you say &quot;AT\r&quot; to it.  This is a lot higher than 
chance, especially if you do it a couple of times and observe the high 
correlation between cause and effect...  (Actually I will give you a 
much better script than just &quot;AT&quot;, which we use here as part of a custom 
modem detection app we have written)

</I>
Sure - agreed.

The reason I mention it here is that it's really a higher level project 
than gpsd, BUT, gpsd has already done quite a lot of the work towards 
that goal and actually you have the same need that I do in the sense 
that we both need a hotplug interface which when a &quot;serial port&quot; is 
connected, determines if that port is connected to a gps, a modem, an 
intelligent plant watering system, or anything else that we still see 
serial ports used for (my users also have HF Pactor modems and all kinds 
of other crazy things that you find on a boat...)

For sure you can say that &quot;we don't care, we only use gps's here and 
tough luck to other people&quot;, but I was actually trying to square the 
circle here and the original point was that &quot;autodetection is a good 
thing rather than having to have the user manually detect things.&quot;  
Although most people on this list may only have one serial port and one 
GPS connected to it, I have a class of users who often have 12-16+ 
serial ports and a wide variety of hardware connected to each of them 
(AIS receivers, NMEA, satellite phones, navigation equipment, boat 
sensors, etc, etc).  I really need a more generic approach to handling 
the hotplug event and figuring out which subsystem should be fired up in 
response to a serial port connection event

Why am I posting here?  Basically because there is already a great 
autodetection in gpsd for a wide class of serial connected devices and 
with a bit of open-mindedness I hope people can see that it might be 
useful to re-use the autodetection part of gpsd for a wider purpose....

Bigger question though - is it clear to everyone why it would be useful 
to bump the autodetection of device type up into the udev stage?  Right 
now gpsd basically has some udev rules which pinches all serial ports, 
tries to use them as a gps and in my experience then continues to sit on 
the device forever after if it just sits there quietly (Eric suggests it 
should drop the device on the floor, this is not what I observe, but 
hopefully the point is clear that this still doesn't fix the problem 
that some other subsystem might want to do something with the device if 
it's NOT a gps?)

Is it clear that some of the gpsd code might make a really nice starting 
point for such a utility?

Thanks for listening

Ed W
