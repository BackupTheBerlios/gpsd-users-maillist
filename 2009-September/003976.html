Hmm, I guess this could be argued.

However, in fairness it's also part of the near universal connect string 
that almost every modem will receive as part of it's normal 
initialisation every time you make a datacall. ie we always assume that 
the modem is buggered when we get it and before we dial it we always zap 
it back to known good defaults.

I can argue the point either way, but I don't think anyone will care 
since it's done like this before each call anyway...


&gt;&gt;<i> Probing a device to see if it's a modem is actually really easy and very  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> reliable.  At the simplest you could just send an AT and see if it  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> reliably responds OK\r.  If you want to be really sure I would suggest

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> extra AT questions give you a pretty good idea what general type of  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> modem it is (wireless or wired in particular)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>

Happy to, but not sitting at the correct computer - please take it as 
red that I will happily provide them though

If you wish to see our autodetection working then grab the software from 
<A HREF="http://www.mailasail.com">http://www.mailasail.com</A> in the Downloads section and run the 
auto-configuration utility with a modem connected.  This client 
autoconfiguration thingy is only for Windows, but the basic probing is 
obviously universal (we use it to figure out what kind of modem the 
customer has and then auto configure it for them - this is fairly hard 
to do (manually) on windows and surprisingly much easier on Linux/Mac)


Cheers
