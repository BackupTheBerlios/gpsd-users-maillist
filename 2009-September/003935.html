<PRE>Paul Fox &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-users">pgf at foxharp.boston.ma.us</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> but on a hand-held device, or even a laptop, the first use after
</I>&gt;<i> boot will likely hit the search phase, right? 
</I>
Yeah, but why care?  It's not like the entire hunt loop takes more
than a maximum of about 1.5 seconds anyway.  I've tested and I know
this -- people who whinge about it taking &quot;a long time&quot; are, frankly,
talking utter horseshit.  One overhead of not more than a second and a
half per host-machine boot is a tiny price for avoiding all the nasty
issues surrounding a baud-rate switch.

&gt;<i>                                                  i suppose one
</I>&gt;<i> could do an &quot;stty 4800 &lt; /dev/ttyGPS&quot; before starting gpsd, but i
</I>&gt;<i> think that depends on linux tty semantics.  (in fact, so does the
</I>&gt;<i> 'try 0 first' trick, right?).
</I>
No.  The interpretation of 0 as &quot;don't change speed&quot; is done by gpsd
itself, not Unix. Unix interprets a change to baud rate 0 as a request
to close the device...I think.  It's not a behavior I would rely on.

&gt;<i>   i applaud your goal of minimum
</I>&gt;<i> config, but a &quot;use this baudrate&quot; option would be useful, in my
</I>&gt;<i> opinion.
</I>
No, it wouldn't.  It would be surrendering to one of the most
dysfunctional habits Unix programmers have, which is to bolt on
configuration switches when they're unwilling or unable to figure out
what the Right Thing is. In this case, the Right Thing is to write gpsd
so it correctly, automatically, adapts to its environment and *doesn't
bother the user to tell it things it can figure out itself*.

I have had to refuse such a request for a baud-rate switch approximately
once every nine months since I took the lead of this project, and I
expect to continue doing so as long as I keep running it.  If you are
on an SBC where the hunt loop isn't useful, you can compile for a fixed port
speed and that's the end of the argument.

&gt;<i> if nothing else, it would work around a problem i saw a while ago
</I>&gt;<i> (which i'm not equipped to re-verify at the moment -- sorry -- i
</I>&gt;<i> hope i'm remembering right).  i believe that it's possible to set
</I>&gt;<i> a baudrate with the 'b' command which will not be searched for in
</I>&gt;<i> the hunt loop.  at the time i was doing gpsd recompiles for other
</I>&gt;<i> reasons, so i simply extended the hunt loop.  (i didn't know
</I>&gt;<i> about the &quot;try current speed first&quot; behavior at the time -- nor
</I>&gt;<i> would i have likely remembered it, it's not a very traditional
</I>&gt;<i> mechanism.)
</I>
So, what you've described isn't even a bug.  You hacked the code to fix
your &quot;problem&quot; before you realized that gpsd would cheerfully reconnect to the 
device and *just work*.

I love the Unix culture.  But this particular &quot;tradition&quot; (bolting on
configuration options as a substitute for autoconfiguration) should die
a swift and horrible death. It's not gpsd that is defective here, it's
your habits of thought.
