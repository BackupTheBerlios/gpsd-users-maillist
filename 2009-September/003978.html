Agreed

However, again without going into corner cases, many of those things are 
usually signalled by strobing DTR or similar? (I guess auto answer isn't?)

Obviously someone could argue this either way, but given the current use 
case is that this is a &quot;suddenly available&quot; serial port which has 
appeared on udev's radar, I would suggest a sensible way to handle this 
situation in the case it was a modem was for our udev tool to realise it 
was a modem and pass it over to some other script to configure it, this 
can then obviously return the modem to whatever state it should be in.  
I'm a big fan of always fully configuring serial modems whenever they 
appear so that you can be sure someone didn't accidently set something 
they shouldn't have done.

It's a completely moot point though - using &quot;AT\r&quot; or &quot;AT&amp;F\r&quot; is 
unlikely to change the detection, it will simply fail to detect the 
modem if it's in some kind of corner state which stops it responding to 
AT commands...  Now someone is bound to point out that we could improve 
this even more by sending something like &quot;++++&quot; first, but this is 
really my point - it's fairly easy to design a bunch of AT commands 
which should detect a VERY high percentage of all devices with very few 
false positives.  AT modems generally just respond in a timely manner 
with either OK or ERROR to pretty much any random string which starts 
with an AT and ends &quot;\r&quot;... (Please dont' take this to the limit, of 
course some AT commands don't return instantly, the point is most do, 
including most random ones even...)

So please DON'T detect AT modems by listening for &quot;OK&quot;.  Instead probe 
them with &quot;ATsomething&quot; and then listen for an OK/ERROR.  Repeat this as 
many times as required to get the confidence as high as you wish.


I think this is actually a fairly simple probe to write based on the 
notes here: <A HREF="http://gpsd.berlios.de/writing-a-driver.html">http://gpsd.berlios.de/writing-a-driver.html</A> - however, I 
have not yet had a crack at it.... Rather hoping someone who knows the 
code a bit better might start me off to be honest...
