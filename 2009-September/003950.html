Or maybe it is a desire not to bind the end user to the limits of the
programmer's finite imagination? (a high ratio of control freaks and
gear heads might explain it too.. :)

I agree that an explosion of options is often used as a programmer's
cop out as opposed to really sitting down and taking the time to choose
good defaults or whatever; thus shifting the work load from the programmer
to the users. This is after all the legend of why Macs still ship with a
one button mouse - it forces the app developers not to be so lazy with
their program design interface.

I can understand the slippery-slope and lead-by-example arguments, even
if I don't really buy into those philosophies completely myself. At the
same time though there is no shame in accepting sage advice and taking
advantage of tip-offs. Quite the opposite actually - at some point it
just becomes plain old bloody-mindedness to ignore those gifts.

My &quot;classic unix programmer&quot; solution would be to have the program check
at search-time for two getenv() enviro variables called for example
GPSD_BAUD_HINT and GPSD_PROTOCOL_HINT:
  GPSD_BAUD_HINT=&quot;4800,N81&quot;
  GPSD_PROTOCOL_HINT=&quot;NMEA&quot;
If present and valid they'd be tried as the first iteration of the search
loop. They don't have to be well advertised, they could be buried down
the bottom of the protocol or debugging help pages. But they would be a
useful debugging tool.

Asking the end-users of the Mac OSX package to recompile just to get
it to work well with their hardware starts to cause more harm than it
solves IMO. The only savior from a 60sec search time is the fact that
the GPS itself might take that long to find a valid fix once powered
up by the USB port. Otherwise it would be ridiculous if the correct
values were known by the human in advance by they had no easy way of
communicating it.

Q: I never could figure out how to run &quot;stty&quot; successfully on OSX, the
example in the Gpsd help pages only works on Linux. Anyone know?
(see ML archives of this list for details of my previous attempts)


As a final point, folks may well be asking for this option because
they have seen it in every other terminal program they've ever used
and can't figure out where it has gone. But there is often deep truth
to be found in &quot;the customer is always right&quot;. They may be totally 
mistaken in their expectations or why the 'need' the widget, but the
query itself belies the fact that something, somewhere, is amiss.


regards,
Hamish
