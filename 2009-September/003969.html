There are other fairly reliable strings you can send which are &quot;widely 
supported&quot;.  As a general rule, all AT commands will finish with a +OK 
or +ERROR in order to show the end of that command output.  Additionally 
&quot;most&quot; AT commands return a result after only a short delay (sure there 
are many that don't, but my point is there are a large number of widely 
supported ones which do, and those fast commands can be used for testing)

So for example in my testing
- I tend to hit the modem with &quot;AT&amp;F&quot; which is factory reset and this 
should come back with OK pretty promptly.
- I do this a few times in a row and eat any extra data - the logic 
being that someone else might have been talking to the modem previously 
and this was garbage, the previous test already confirmed we were 
&quot;likely&quot; to be talking to a modem, so now we are just trying to get 
control of it's output so that we can measure cause and effect when we 
interrogate it
- After this I hit it with a couple of AT commands to check make and 
model (+CGMR / +GMR from memory, need to check). These are good 
identification strings for the device
- In my application I then run a few tests to see if it's likely a 
3G/wireless data card, over and above a normal modem.  This is useful 
data for me since we deal with both classes of device.  I do this by 
testing if it supports certain types of additional AT command.  This 
would be a good time to check for the small class of cell phone devices 
which have a builtin GPS and can output this data over AT or similar (or 
be flipped into some gps data mode).  This is admittedly a fairly small 
number of devices, but it's not zero (Siemens modules spring to mind, 
some Iridium satellite phones and a few other satellite phones, perhaps 
some of the fancy nokia N series, etc)

Incidently with AT modems they can be interrogated to see *if* they 
support certain AT commands.  So you can get a near immediate response 
back to the question as to whether the modem supports a given AT 
command, which can obviously be different to the output of actually 
running that AT command itself!  This allows a great deal of flexibility 
in probing

I think the main thing you might be missing (or I misunderstand your 
answer?) is that modems as a class just sit there and don't *do 
anything* until you probe them..  There are no &quot;OK&quot; strings coming out 
of a modem or any other string for that matter - they just sit quietly 
until you talk to them!  However, as a class they respond very promptly 
to certain well specified and well documented commands and those 
commands DO follow a very specific and rigid structure (specifically 
they must end with I think it's OK\r or ERROR\r and may have a variable 
length response before that)

Probing a device to see if it's a modem is actually really easy and very 
reliable.  At the simplest you could just send an AT and see if it 
reliably responds OK\r.  If you want to be really sure I would suggest 
you do that a couple of times (remember the extra few milliseconds are 
only spent once you already are pretty sure it's a modem...)  A few 
extra AT questions give you a pretty good idea what general type of 
modem it is (wireless or wired in particular)

In case we are talking cross purposes, I think detection of additional 
device types is really for excluding them from gpsd using them.  
Additionally this functionality is best pushed up to the udev level so I 
would propose to pinch the main detection loop from gpsd, break it into 
a separate utility which classifies devices and then once they are 
detected to be a gps pushes them back to the main gps daemon or 
somewhere else if not.  I hope someone else will suggest an even neater 
algorithm, but this seems like a good starting point...

THanks for listening...
