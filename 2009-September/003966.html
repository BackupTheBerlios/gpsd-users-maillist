They do if, like gpsd, you're running a hunt loop through various
possible speeds and mode settings.  I actually don't know of any more
effective way to encounter random baud barf than this. :-) You're
right that the distribution might be nonrandom, but the nonrandomness
could just as easily make the odds worse instead of better.

And even 4.5 hours mean time between possible false positives is bad
compared to the odds from CRC-32 checks, which essentially *never*
fail - you'd need the noise burst to be spread out over more than, hm, I
think it's 23 consecutive bits, and that doesn't happen on serial 
lines that are even approximately functional.  

When I said that potential tests had a really high reliability bar to
climb over I wasn't kidding. If a probe is going to actually decrease the 
expected time between false positives or false negatives, I don't want it;
maximum time before throwing the device back in the pool with our
existing method is not in my judgement long enough to justify taking on
increased risk of failure to shorten it.

&gt;<i>    What I don't like about the idea of detecting modems is that I don't

</I>
In principle that could be useful enough by itself, by shortening the time
before gpsd gives up on the device.

&gt;<i>                       (unless you are dealing with a Thuraya phone,
</I>&gt;<i> which will respond to an &quot;AT\r&quot; as a modem, but will also give you its
</I>&gt;<i> GPS position given the right AT command).  Detecting what specific
</I>&gt;<i> device is on the serial port belongs somewhere else.
</I>
Probably in the HAL demon.  Back when that project was launching the
lead tried to talk me into letting gpsd be subsumed into it.  I told him no,
as I didn't want my nice clean small daemon to disappear into a gigantic
gooey hairball of unmaintainable code.  But if HAL actually did that kind of
device-fingerprint detection reliably I would happily outsource the job to it.
