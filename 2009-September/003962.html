&gt;<i> I find it curious that you are so keen on autoconfiguration (which I  
</I>&gt;<i> wholly agree is a great goal!), yet you were apparently dismissive of my  
</I>&gt;<i> suggestions to add detection of AT serial modems to gpsd (with the goal  
</I>&gt;<i> of then avoiding using them as a gps)?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't mean to hijack this thread, but perhaps I could suggest this  
</I>&gt;<i> autoconfiguration goal could be taken even futher with a view to  
</I>&gt;<i> figuring out when we *don't* have a gps?
</I>
I didn't think I was being dismissive, it's just that I have not yet seen a
proposal that I'm convinced would improve on the detection we already do.

Recognizing an unknown device as a GPS is not hard, if it is one.  You
watch it for a second or two, sniffing for one of the known packet
types. Because they're all checksummed, you can be quite confident
that when you get packet sync you have real data.

Presently our algorithm is simple - watch for hotplugs, sniff the new
device, and if it's not recognizable as a GPS within a few seconds
let it go.  Yes, we could look for signatures of non-GPS devices in
the serial bitstream, but it wouldn't be time-efficient to do so
unless recognizing (say) a modem can be done significantly more
quickly *and* more reliably than running all the is-this-a-GPS checks
and concluding by exhaustion that &quot;...nope, it isn't.&quot;.

That's a very difficult bar to get over.  The main reason it's
difficult is that other device classes don't checksum their data,
producing a substantial risk of false positives.

If you want this sort of feature, it's not enough to wave your hands
and say &quot;it should be done&quot;.  You'd need to give me a specific set of
send-expect pairs that mean &quot;not a GPS&quot;, and then you'd have to convince
me that the response is statistically highly unlikely to occur in 
baud barf. 

And by &quot;highly unlikely&quot; I mean that the odds of a false positive
have to be lower than those offered by a CRC-32 integrity check. If
they're higher, your probe would actually do net damage by 
decreasing the MTBF of the is-it-a-GPS test.
