I'm not an expert on ntp, but I think I believe it's default is to 
remain out of step, hence the desire to run ntp-client on boot if you 
need to step the clock?

Give chrony a go, it's got a lot more features to help with this...

</I>
Given the lifetimes are usually good for a lithium cell this would imply 
that you have long expected service times for these units?  Curious...

I guess cost is a concern, but I would assume a supercap is more 
expensive than a lithium cell?  Could you increase service intervals by 
doubling up on cells?  Is a combo of both within budget?


I think chrony will likely sort you out anyway.  Give it a try!
