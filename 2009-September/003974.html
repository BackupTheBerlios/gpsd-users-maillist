Try &quot;chrony&quot; - it's a rather neat ntp implementation which has given a 
lot of thought to this kind of situation.  If you check the mailing list 
there is a chap who has posted patches which can take the gpsd output 
directly into chrony (there are some other patches which can use ntp as 
an intermediary, but I don't think you want this)

Chrony can be configured to step when the time change is large.  Also it 
can be used to do clever things like combine a gps + upstream ntp.  It 
appears to converge VERY much faster than ntp (mins/secs instead of 
hours) and it even has a bunch of features to condition your RTC clock 
if this is useful

If you have control over the hardware you could also consider replacing 
whatever supercap is there for a lithium cell so that your RTC works for 
longer?  Chrony is still useful in that it uses the RTC much more 
intelligently

Good luck
