   ...while I have no stakes in this, I would like to point out that,
strictly, the modem should be returning &quot;OK\r&quot; (IIRC), so that
particular string would be seen once every about 4:50 hours. Of course,
most serial devices don't just sit there sending random uniformly
distributed 8 bit characters :)

   What I don't like about the idea of detecting modems is that I don't
see how that can be useful to gpsd, other than deciding that it's
possibly not a GPS device (unless you are dealing with a Thuraya phone,
which will respond to an &quot;AT\r&quot; as a modem, but will also give you its
GPS position given the right AT command).  Detecting what specific
device is on the serial port belongs somewhere else.

   To solve Ed's problem (and I know exactly what he's talking about), I
would probably suggest using a computer with one usable serial port and
one usable USB port, along with a serial-only modem and a USB-only GPS.


Regards,
Diego Berge.
