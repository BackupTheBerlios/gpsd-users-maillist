 &gt; &gt;                                                  i suppose one
 &gt; &gt; could do an &quot;stty 4800 &lt; /dev/ttyGPS&quot; before starting gpsd, but i
 &gt; &gt; think that depends on linux tty semantics.  (in fact, so does the
 &gt; &gt; 'try 0 first' trick, right?).
 &gt; 
 &gt; No.  The interpretation of 0 as &quot;don't change speed&quot; is done by gpsd
 &gt; itself, not Unix. Unix interprets a change to baud rate 0 as a request
 &gt; to close the device...I think.  It's not a behavior I would rely on.

sorry, i certainly wasn't clear.  it's the behavior of preserving
the current baud rate across a device close/open which i believe is
a linux-ism.  at least, it was definitely a change from unix tty
behavior that i first observed in linux -- perhaps it's customary
behavior everywhere (or perhaps even specified by posix) now.  i've
never viewed it as more than a convenience before this.

...
 &gt; &gt; if nothing else, it would work around a problem i saw a while ago
 &gt; &gt; (which i'm not equipped to re-verify at the moment -- sorry -- i
 &gt; &gt; hope i'm remembering right).  i believe that it's possible to set
 &gt; &gt; a baudrate with the 'b' command which will not be searched for in
 &gt; &gt; the hunt loop.  at the time i was doing gpsd recompiles for other
 &gt; &gt; reasons, so i simply extended the hunt loop.  (i didn't know
 &gt; &gt; about the &quot;try current speed first&quot; behavior at the time -- nor
 &gt; &gt; would i have likely remembered it, it's not a very traditional
 &gt; &gt; mechanism.)
 &gt; 
 &gt; So, what you've described isn't even a bug.  You hacked the code to fix
 &gt; your &quot;problem&quot; before you realized that gpsd would cheerfully
 &gt; reconnect to the device and *just work*.

if it it had &quot;just worked&quot;, i wouldn't have had to hack.  in
general i don't modify code needlessly.  gpsd wouldn't find my
device because my device was running at a speed not in the hunt
loop.  how would &quot;preserve previous baud rate&quot; help there?  you're
making assumptions that the device is only used for gpsd, perhaps?
or that no reboots were involved?  again, apologies for not being
able to recreate this right now, in order to be more confident in
what i'm remembering.

 &gt; 
 &gt; I love the Unix culture.  But this particular &quot;tradition&quot; (bolting on
 &gt; configuration options as a substitute for autoconfiguration) should die
 &gt; a swift and horrible death. It's not gpsd that is defective here, it's
 &gt; your habits of thought.

please.  lose the condescension.
