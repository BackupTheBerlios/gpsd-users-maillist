<PRE> 
The main reason for starting this thread about the fix baudrate was that
sometimes gpsd does not found the correct baudrate.
In this case the output of gpsd shows:...

gpsd: packet sniff finds type 0

and this never ends.

Normally i can see 

gpsd: packet sniff finds type -1

and every 30 seconds the gpsd starts with a new baudrate.

What are the reason for this behaviour?

Kai

</I>
&quot;A desire not to bind the end user to the limits of the programmer's finite
imagination&quot; is both the soundest and the most frequently cited reason for
many Unix traditions, yes.  I endorsed it as a general argument myself in my
book &quot;The Art Of Unix Programming&quot; (TAOUP).  I think in general, acting on
this desire is a good thing and to be encouraged.

But I said &quot;as a substitute for autoconfiguration&quot;. That makes a much more
specific claim about a very specific kind of situation, one where an option
switch is used to tell a program something that it can and should deduce for
itself.  If autoconfiguration &quot;binds the end user to limits&quot;, then the right
way to think about it is that *it's being done wrong and should be fixed*,
not that autoconfiguration should be discarded in favor of a hasty,
thoughtless grab for an option switch.
 
&gt;<i> I agree that an explosion of options is often used as a programmer's 
</I>&gt;<i> cop out as opposed to really sitting down and taking the time to 
</I>&gt;<i> choose good defaults or whatever; thus shifting the work load from the 
</I>&gt;<i> programmer to the users.
</I>
While that's true, it's actually not the sort of design error that is
provoking my ire.  Good choice of defaults is often disputable.  Many other
possible options of the what-background-color-do-you-want kind are matters
of taste.  In these situations giving users lots of flavor options is
readily defensible.

What baud rate and protocol gpsd should set to make sense of incoming data
are not like this -- these are not &quot;flavor&quot; options, these are &quot;drop-dead&quot;
options. There is only one right baud rate and protocol; if you choose
wrongly, you lose - you don't just get an unpleasant taste, *nothing works
at all*.  And gpsd can figure out the right values in less than a minute -
on a Linux box, not more than two seconds, and normally the time overhead is
close to zero (fewer than three packet transits).

It's that combination - errors being fatal plus discoverability - that makes
the case for autoconfiguration open and shut.  It's not like choosing the
style of your window decorations!

&gt;<i> I can understand the slippery-slope and lead-by-example arguments, 
</I>&gt;<i> even if I don't really buy into those philosophies completely myself. 
</I>&gt;<i> At the same time though there is no shame in accepting sage advice and 
</I>&gt;<i> taking advantage of tip-offs. Quite the opposite actually - at some 
</I>&gt;<i> point it just becomes plain old bloody-mindedness to ignore those gifts.
</I>
Yes?  Riddle me this, Batman...you've been around, you know how frequently
end users will screw up and misconfigure critical knobs like baud rates and
protocol selectors if there's any way for that to happen.  Over the last
five years, how many stupid pilot errors would you suppose I've avoided by
*not* having these switches?

If it's bloody-mindedness for me to prefer shipping a tool that just works
in 99.9% of cases to one where there are drop-dead options sticking out all
over that end-users routinely fuck themselves up with, I accept the
indictment and plead for more bloody-mindedness in the world.

Applying the kind of thinking that defends flavor options to drop-dead
options is a bad mental habit, an overgeneralization, a category error that
Unix programmers need to unlearn.  Yes, this means *you*, Hamish!  And you,
Paul Fox.  

Your Unix-tradition reflexes are blinding you to significant life-cycle
costs.  Here's another one besides users shooting themselves in the foot:
when you have n drop-dead options, test complexity rises on the order of
2**n.

&gt;<i> My &quot;classic unix programmer&quot; solution would be to have the program 
</I>&gt;<i> check at search-time for two getenv() enviro variables called for 
</I>&gt;<i> example GPSD_BAUD_HINT and GPSD_PROTOCOL_HINT:
</I>&gt;<i>   GPSD_BAUD_HINT=&quot;4800,N81&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>   GPSD_PROTOCOL_HINT=&quot;NMEA&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> If present and valid they'd be tried as the first iteration of the 
</I>&gt;<i> search loop. They don't have to be well advertised, they could be 
</I>&gt;<i> buried down the bottom of the protocol or debugging help pages. But 
</I>&gt;<i> they would be a useful debugging tool.
</I>
And if I ever circumvent our autoconfiguration at runtime, that's very
likely how I'll do it.  You've proposed about the most subtle and
understated way to address the problem that fits within Unix tradition.

But now my problem is exactly that the gravitational pull of that tradition
is so strong.  Once I've conceded that we're going to fall back into
option-switch-as-band-aid behavior even once, where does it stop?
 
&gt;<i> As a final point, folks may well be asking for this option because 
</I>&gt;<i> they have seen it in every other terminal program they've ever used 
</I>&gt;<i> and can't figure out where it has gone. But there is often deep truth 
</I>&gt;<i> to be found in &quot;the customer is always right&quot;. They may be totally 
</I>&gt;<i> mistaken in their expectations or why the 'need' the widget, but the 
</I>&gt;<i> query itself belies the fact that something, somewhere, is amiss.
</I>
Yeah.  Blame it on RS-232.  But arguing that gpsd should be brain-dead
because
RS-232 is won't get you anywhere with me.
