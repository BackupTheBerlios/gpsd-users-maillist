Initial thoughts:

You are going to need two GPS receivers, one on your subject and one
on your camera.  This is so you can compute the distance and speed
between these two points.

The hard part is the GPS on your subject.  For something like a race
car it's not a big deal; for something like an athlete who is running
or bicycling or whatever it might be.  The subject GPS doesn't have to
be as big as a hand-held GPS of the type you might use while hiking - it
doesn't need a display, and it probably doesn't need a long battery life.
I have worked with a GPS module that was around 1&quot; x 3&quot; x 0.25&quot; (25 x
75 x 6 mm) without an antenna; GPS antennae vary but one common shape is
a disc or puck that is maybe 2&quot; diameter x 0.5&quot; thick (50 mm x 12 mm).
You will also need some kind of wireless transmitter, but these are also
available as relatively small modules.  The power requirements will
probably be fairly modest, on the order of 5 or 10 watts or so.  If you
can plug into a vehicle electrical system you are golden; if you need a
battery, and it only has to work once during the race, you can probably
use something like a single AA alkaline battery, or maybe even smaller.
If it has to work more than once, you need a little more battery.

One question is what protocol you will use to transmit the GPS data from
the subject.  It looks like Bluetooth might not have the range that is
required in your application.  You might be able to use plain old Wi-Fi,
but there may be interference issues; you might not be the only person
wanting to run Wi-Fi at the car race or the marathon.  :)  Also, if you
use Wi-Fi, you probably need a small computer on the subject to get the
location information over the GPS serial port and hand it off to the
Wi-Fi transmitter.  Some vendors offer a &quot;wireless serial port&quot;;
basically you have two radios that behave to the connected devices as if
they were connected via a plain old serial port cable.  This would let
you get away with no separate computer on the subject, saving space,
weight, and power.

The GPS on your camera is not as big of a deal.  If the camera lens
doesn't move, it can be as simple as strapping a handheld GPS (from
Garmin, etc) on top of your camera, and keying the coordinates that it
reports into the computer.  For a more automated solution, you could use
the same kind of GPS module that you are using on the subject.

For both GPSes, an important point is that all of the hardware doesn't
have to go in the same place.  The GPS antenna has to go somewhere where
it has a good view of the sky, but the rest of the electronics can go
elsewhere. This means that you have a 2&quot; diameter x 0.5&quot; thick &quot;puck&quot;
on top of the race car, or on top of the runner's head, or on top of
your camera, or whatever, and a thin coaxial cable (maybe 1/8&quot; or 3 mm
diameter) to the rest of the electronics, which can be several feet away
(6 to 10 feet (2 to 3.5 m) is easy and farther is possible.)

At your camera, you are going to need a computer to do the math and set
the speed of your camera motor.  This can be a laptop, or a single-board
computer.  It will need a couple of serial ports (or USB-to-serial
converters) to talk to the GPSes, plus whatever interface you need for
your camera motor.  The user interface can be as simple as a big red
button that you push to make it go, or as complex as a regular monitor
and keyboard.  Often for applications like this, a small numeric keypad
and alphanumeric LCD (think &quot;cell phone&quot;) is an OK interface.  Presumably
you have more power available at the camera; it's easy to do all of this
in 30 watts and probably possible to do it in 10 watts.  The packaging
varies a lot (laptop vs. single-board computer) but you can probably do
it in a box that is 6&quot; x 8&quot; x 2&quot; thick (150 x 200 x 50 mm).

Some of the pitfalls you may face are:

GPS accuracy.  It's a lot better than it used to be, but it still may not
be as precise as you need.  There are techniques (differential GPS and
WAAS) that improve the accuracy, but they are not available everywhere.
Both of your GPSes have to support whatever accuracy-improvement
technique that you use.

GPS update rate/latency.  Most inexpensive GPS modules update once
a second.  Some newer modules are available that update 5 times a
second.  If you need faster updates than this, GPS may not be
appropriate.

GPS signal strength / sky view.  If you are filming a bicycle race out
in the countryside, no problem.  If you are filming something like the
New York Marathon, with tall buildings all around, the GPS receivers may
not be able to see enough satellites to give you useful data.  GPS will
also have trouble in enclosed stadiums.

Note: For the above three issues, there are devices available that combine
GPS receivers with accelerometers and solid-state gyroscopes to give
you pretty good position and speed information even when the GPS
signal is not great; basically they &quot;fill in the blanks&quot; between GPS
updates via dead reckoning.  These were first designed to go in
airplanes, so they aren't cheap, but you can get them.

Putting your device on the subject.  For something like NASCAR this is
probably easier; they won't complain *too* much about 10 watts and one
or two pounds (0.5 to 1 kg).  For something like a marathon runner, this
might be a deal-breaker.  You might have to have someone working for
you to act as a &quot;pacer&quot;; he or she wears the GPS and runs/bicycles/skates/
whatever along with the racers, but isn't actually participating in the
race. This means that they only have to be fit enough to keep up with
the pack for as long as it takes you to get the shot.  :)  You may have
to &quot;sell&quot; this to the race sanctioning body, though.

The place for gpsd in this is at the computer you are using at the
camera, and possibly on the computer you are using at the subject, if
you have one.  This does assume you are running Linux or some flavor of
Unix (FreeBSD, etc) on these computers.  gpsd would deliver the position
and speed information from the two GPS receivers to your application.
Your application would do the math, compute a motor speed, give the
speed to the motor control hardware, and handle whatever user interface
you want.

The version 0.0 prototype is probably an old junk PC or laptop (a
Pentium-III is probably overkill), a cheap consumer GPS at the PC,
another cheap consumer GPS sewed to a baseball hat, and a real long
cable from the baseball hat to the PC.  First you see if the update rate
and accuracy of the GPSes will work for you - can you compute RPM
changes fast enough?  (You may have to use some film figuring this out,
which is the not-cheap part.)  From there, you can decide if you have to
buy higher-grade GPS receiver modules, or can get away with cheap ones;
buy those and do it again.  Then cut the cable and implement the wireless
link.  Finally, move to your production solution for the computer at the
camera (laptop or single-board computer) and add the user interface - this
comes relatively late in the game, because it's generally much nicer to
develop, test, and debug with a full monitor and keyboard.  Then you
mechanically package everything and go take some pictures.  :)

You probably need to come up with some initial specifications on
possible subject speeds and update rates - both how fast can the subject
change speed, and how fast you need to know about the new speed to
adjust the camera correctly.  You probably also need to decide how big
of a package you can put on the subject.  Then, start shopping for a
local engineering firm / electrical engineer / computer geek to assist
with the software and hardware.  Some key words for this are probably
&quot;embedded&quot;, &quot;GPS&quot;, and &quot;Linux&quot;.

I hope this helps!
