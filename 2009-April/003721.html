The &quot;read-only&quot; and the 9600 bps are most likely because of the -b
switch.  Many (most?) GPS receivers start life with a serial port only.
When everybody wanted serial, the only extra piece you needed was
something to change the 0 V/5 V serial that came out of the GPS receiver
to the -12 V/12 V serial that an RS-232 serial port wants.  Really cheap
chips to do this reliably have existed since before GPS existed, so that
was no problem.

Then people decided they wanted USB.  A lot of GPS manufacturers just
ran the serial port from the receiver into a serial-to-USB chip (really
a custom microprocessor).  The serial-to-USB chips had also been pretty
thoroughly debugged (although I'm sure there were some early ones that
sucked) - in particular, they didn't mind if the serial device (the GPS
receiver) suddenly started speaking at a different rate.  The serial-to-
USB chip would figure it out, adjust its speed to match the serial
device, and life was OK.

Then people decided they wanted Bluetooth.  The GPS manufacturers
noticed the pattern and ran the serial port from the receiver into a
serial-to-Bluetooth chip (really a custom microprocessor plus a radio).
The problem here is that some of the serial-to-Bluetooth chips are
buggy, and can't deal with the idea that the serial device (the GPS
receiver) might suddenly start speaking at a different rate.  Since most
GPSes can be commanded to switch speeds over their serial port, this is
sometimes a problem.  There have been cases where gpsd started talking
to a GPS at (say) 9600 bps, and then told the GPS to switch to (say)
57600 bps.  The GPS switched to 57600 bps just fine, but the Bluetooth
chip was still expecting the GPS to be at 9600 bps, resulting in no
communication.  Sometimes when this happens, it can't be fixed in
software; you have to do something like remove *all* the sources of
power from the GPS and let it sit for a while so everything resets.

Since this is bad, the -b switch tells gpsd to not write to the GPS
at all - gpsd won't try to switch speeds or reconfigure the GPS in
any way.  You may not get the best performance out of your GPS this
way, but you probably won't break it, either.

&gt;<i> I tried running gpsd without additional parameters but made no
</I>&gt;<i> difference.
</I>
I was going to say to try it without the -b switch, but you already
tried that.  (Did the log files say anything interesting when you
did that?  You might try &quot;sudo gpsd -n -N -D2 /dev/rfcomm4&quot; so you
still get the debug messages on the console.)

If this is a brand new GPS, have you let it run for a while in a place
with a good view of the sky?  Some GPS receivers can take a relatively
long time (like a half-hour) to initialize for the very first time
ever, or if they have been moved a long distance (thousands of miles)
since they were last powered on.  You don't have to have it synced
to a computer for this; you just have to turn it on and let it sit
there.

You might try running minicom (a terminal emulator) and pointing it
at /dev/rfcomm4 .  Don't run gpsd for this; just use minicom.  If the
GPS is synced to the Bluetooth receiver, you should see *something*
coming in - it may or may not be NMEA strings (which are ASCII and
sort of human-readable), but you should at least get some response.
If you don't, then you have some lower-level problem with Bluetooth
or with the GPS itself.
