<PRE>Perhaps this is where some of the SiRF delay is coming from...

Sent to you by Chris Kuethe via Google Reader: EM406 dynamic response
is fine: mystery solved via Everyone's Blog Posts - DIY Drones by
William Premerlani on 4/20/09 The mystery of the 12 second latency in
the dynamic response of the EM406 GPS is solved.

Recently, I stirred up a debate about whether or not the EM406 has a 12
second latency or not. A few of us were seeing a 12 second latency. The
majority of EM406 users were not seeing it.

It turns out that the dynamic performance of the EM406 depends on which
interface you use, NMEA or binary. If you use binary, there is a 12
second latency, then a 3 second &quot;smoothing&quot; transient.

If you use NMEA, there is a smoothing transient only. The NMEA
interface to the EM406 provides dynamic performance as good as the
LOCOSYS or the ET312.

It is my speculation that &quot;track smoothing&quot; is turned on in the EM406
for the binary interface, and either it is always on, or I have not
figured out how to turn it off. If anyone knows how to turn track
smoothing off in the binary interface for the EM406, please let me know
so that I do not have to scrap my binary interface and start over on a
NMEA interface.
