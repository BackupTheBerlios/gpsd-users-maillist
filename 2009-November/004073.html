As far as I can tell, the device only &quot;speaks&quot; Serial. It has a 9pin
serial connector. How you connect that to your PC is your problem. If
you have a serial port on your PC you can connect it there, If you
have a PCMCIA serial port on your laptop you can connect it there. If
you have an USB serial port on your computer, you can connect it
there.

You might even buy the serial adapter with Garmin. That makes it
&quot;supported by Garmin&quot;, but if it goes through a 9pin serial connector,
saying it is serial is as far as you should go.

A FAQ entry might say: 

Q: How do I connect a serial device? 

A: Some computers still have serial ports. These are 25 or 9 pin
D-type connectors on the back of the PC (or on an adapter board).
More and more modern computers are shipped without a serial port.
Thus you may need an USB serial adapter or an adapter board. USB
serial ports can be bought for as little as $3 over the internet or
for about $10 - $20 in your local computer store.

Q: It doesn't work. A: Look buddy, doesn't work is an ambiguous statement. 
Does it sit on the couch all day? Is it unemployed? Please be specific!
