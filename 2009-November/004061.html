<PRE>
 Hello,
 
 I am using Viking GPS Manager running
 under Ubuntu Linux on my laptop and connect it to a Garmin
 handheld GPS 76 device to implement an excellent SatNav
 system. 
 
 Viking uses gpsd to provide real time 3D position
 information. It's extremely easy, in principle, to set this
 up and the results are first class. Tested by using xgps the
 values shown on the xgps window are EXACTLY those displayed
 on the GPS device. Testing using Viking, the cursor jumps
 immediately to my present location on the displayed maps. 
 
 I would like to thank ALL the collaborators for their work
 in providing the truly excellent gpsd software!
 
 Despite there being a trivial solution I COULD NOT by
 myself get gpsd to communicate with the Garmin. There are so
 many options and possibilities that it's necessary to know
 exactly what you are doing or you get nowhere. In the end I
 had to seek advice and I am grateful to Gary E Miller who
 responded to my cry for help rapidly and with spot-on
 information about what I should do.
 
 My Solution
 =================
 
 My laptop is a Lenovo 3000 C200. The operating system is
 Ubuntu Linux v 9.10 (Karmic Kaola!) My chosen GPS Manager is
 Viking v0.98 and I am using gpsd v 2.39 (the most up-to-date
 version that I could find on the berliOS website) so that 
 Viking can obtain current position updates. 
 
 My GPS device is a Garmin GPS 76
 handheld which communicates to a PC through an RS232
 interface. The Lenovo doesn't have an RS232 socket so I
 connect via a USB-Serial Interface and install the usbserial
 Linux driver module to enable it as /dev/ttyUSB0. 
 
 I set the Garmin hardware's comms to &quot;NMEA&quot;.
 
 I issue the command &quot;gpsd /dev/ttyUSB0&quot; to start the
 daemon.
 
 And that's it! Perfect operation - fast updates and very
 accurate position reports.
 
 What was my problem?
 =============================
 
 CAVEAT: I hope that the gpsd development collaborators
 won't take offense about any of this but rather that this
 mail will be of some assistance as the observations of a
 happy and grateful, but not especially linux savvy, user 
 of gpsd.
 
 The first resource that I read was the on-line manual
 viewed by issuing &quot;man gpsd&quot; at a terminal. With the benefit
 of hindsight I've re-read the complete manual to see whether
 I could have deduced the solution suggested by Gary. Sadly I
 believe that I would not have succeeeded.
 
 The manual has the following outline:
 
 a) The SYNOPSIS (lines 9/10) - interesting but all I needed
 was the much simpler syntax: &quot;gpsd source_name&quot;. IMPORTANT:
 &quot;source_name&quot; is a KEY parameter. What this is, however, is
 not explained anywhere in the document and only a few,
 vague, clues appear MUCH further down. 
 
 b) The DESCRIPTION - a useful introduction to the purpose
 of gpsd. Interesting but not relevant to getting gpsd
 talking to my Garmin. The suggested probe &quot;gpsd -l&quot; produces
 a list of possible protocols - 22 in my case, many obviously
 inappropriate - without any guidance as to which should be
 used - not very helpful.
 
 c) The OPTIONS (starting with the -F option) - Interesting
 but not relevant. My solution needs NO options.
 
 d) The remaining document - interesting but not helpful.
 Line 146 warns that from then on a large chunk is deprecated
 anyway!
 
 The &quot;clues&quot;:
 
 - in line 114! - it says that &quot;Normally, a data source is
 the name of a local serial device from which the daemon may
 expect GPS data.&quot; What is meant by &quot;name&quot; here is never
 explained. 
 
 -in line 702 and 763! - some passing references to
 &quot;/dev/ttyS0&quot; in line 702 and 763! Flash of light! - the
 source_name is just the Linux device file (thus &quot;gpsd
 /dev/ttyUSB0&quot; for my solution.) 
 
 How could this be changed?
 ================================
 I suggest that, to help people in my situation who &quot;just&quot;
 need to get the daemon talking to a gps device as quickly
 and easily as possible:
 
 1) Immediately after the section &quot;SYNOPSIS&quot; add a new
 section &quot;EXAMPLES OF BASIC OPERATION&quot;. 
 
 The examples would probably be something like &quot;gpsd
 /dev/ttyS0&quot;. Perhaps half a dozen or so would suffice to
 cover a majority of basic implementations.
 
 2) At the end of the &quot;EXAMPLES...&quot; section add the
 paragraph:
 
 &quot;For your first connection tests, set your GPS hardware
 device comms to &quot;NMEA&quot; (check the User Manual of your GPS
 hardware device to find out how to do this). Most devices
 will talk this protocol. After you have successfully
 communicated with your device using this protocol you can
 try others to see whether they offer any speed or
 functionality advantages.&quot;
 
 Next point the reader to the &quot;Compatible Hardware&quot; table to
 be found on the web at <A HREF="http:///gpsd.berlios.de/hardware.html.">http:///gpsd.berlios.de/hardware.html.</A> 
 
 The following would also be helpful: 
 
 &quot;You can test correct operation by first starting gpsd and
 then xgps (the X-Windows test client for gpsd). You should
 ensure that your GPS device has a good fix and that it is
 displaying your current location. Then, if all is well, the
 xgps x-window will display EXACTLY the same location data.&quot;
 
 Finally, in case the user doesn't get the connection
 working, make sure that the he/she knows about the
 &quot;Troubleshooting&quot; document to be found (at least in the
 Ubuntu distribution) at /usr/share/doc/gpds. To be honest
 this document didn't help me either and I suggest that it
 should be revised radically. But that's another subject.
 
 3) To be truly helpful the Compatible Hardware table should
 be extended to show also HOW the hardware is to be used. A
 few simple additions should suffice. In this context I would
 like to see the following added to the Garmin GPS 76 entry:
 
 In the Notes column: 
 
 &quot;This device can be connected directly to a Serial RS232
 port on the computer using the special PC connector lead
 supplied by Garmin (a 9-pin RS232 connector is used at the
 PC end). Issue the command 'gpsd /dev/ttyS0', or similar, in
 a terminal window to start gpsd.
 
 The device can also be connected to a USB socket on the PC
 by using a USB-Serial converter lead. In this latter case,
 in Linux, the usbserial Kernel Module must be loaded and
 started with a command such as 'sudo modprobe usbserial
 vendor=0&#215;1a86 product=0&#215;7523' (check the manual for your
 usb-serial converter device for more information on this -
 vendor and product number will most likely be different for
 your device). Start gpsd by issuing the command 'gpsd
 /dev/ttyUSB0' or similar in a terminal window. In this case
 the Garmin GPS 76 comms MUST be set to 'NMEA'. The kernel
 module garmin_gps is not needed and should not be specially
 loaded.&quot;
 
 
 ---End of addition---
 
 Unfortunately, at present I believe that the table also has
 some errors in its content for the Garmin GPS 76 device:
 
 1) The device interface should be shown as &quot;RS232&quot; not
 &quot;USB&quot; (even if the connection is made via a usb-serial
 converter lead.) Garmin supplies a lead for transferring
 data to/from a computer. This lead connects between the GPS
 76 device and a 9-pin RS232 connector. I could not find any
 reference in the user manual to a lead that can be connected
 directly between the GPS device and a computer USB port.
 2) Because it's RS232 the exclamation icon in the &quot;tested
 with&quot; column is not appropriate. Connecting the Garmin will
 probably not start the gpsd daemon. Plugging the usb-serial
 device lead into a computer socket WOULD load the usbserial
 driver module and might start the daemon if the system was
 set up to do that (mine isn't). Anyway NOT correct as it
 stands.
 3) There's a coding bug in the html which makes the three
 star designation in &quot;tested with&quot; column look wrong (see
 attached image). For a long time I thought that the rating
 was just ONE star or at best TWO and I nearly gave up!!!!
 The image is copied from the Firefox browser but the page
 displayed by IE7 is similarly corrupt.
 
 Sincerely,
 
 Geoff Childs
