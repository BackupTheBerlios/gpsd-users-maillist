<PRE>I'm trying to get gpsd to report PPS-corrected time stamps (via shared
memory) to ntpd, on an OpenBSD 4.6 system, using &quot;ldattach&quot; to invoke
the &quot;nmea&quot; line discipline (see OpenBSD's &quot;ldattach&quot; manual page if you
aren't sure what this means) on a serial device to which I've attached a
Garmin 18x LVC GPS unit.

I'm using the current gpsd sources from SVN (revision 6600).

I can get gpsd to read the GPS and report its regular timestamps (not
corrected for PPS) via shared memory -- but the second set of timestamps
(which *are* corrected for PPS) are not being communicated to ntpd.

I've tried running gpsd with logging (-D 5), and none of the PPS-related
log messages in ntpshm.c or libgpsd_core.c are being output.

As I examine the source code, it appears that the PPS-corrected timestamp
data is written to shared memory via ntpshm_pps() in ntpshm.c -- which is
called at only one place, in gpsd_ppsmonitor() in libgpsd_core.c.  But
gpsd_ppsmonitor() is conditionally defined to be included only if *both*
PPS_ENABLE *and* TIOCMIWAIT are defined.

PPS_ENABLE is defined in gpsd_config.h, but TIOCMIWAIT appears to be a
Linux-specific thing that doesn't exist in OpenBSD.

I had been under the impression that PPS data from a reference clock
could be processed in OpenBSD, via a combination of &quot;ldattach&quot;, &quot;gpsd&quot;,
and &quot;ntpd&quot;.  Did I misunderstand?  Am I missing some crucial piece?

I've verified that my Garmin GPS unit is configured to emit PPS pulses,
and I've also verified (on FreeBSD and Linux) that I've correctly wired
up the GPS to send the PPS signals via the carrier line of the serial
port.  I want to get this working in OpenBSD, if possible, because I'm
looking for a software platform that will support PPS out of the box,
without requiring a custom-built kernel -- and this appears to be a
realistic possibility in OpenBSD, but not Linux or FreeBSD.
