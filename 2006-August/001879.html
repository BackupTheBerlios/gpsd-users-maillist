I'm told embedded is tricky. And I'm not a complete embedded systems
wizard but I'll take a shot at wrestling with your ARM.

&gt;<i> My setup is an ARM9 / AT91RM9200 uClinux based system with a 2.6.14 kernel.

Sounds OK so far. I'm running a zaurus (PXA270 xscale core) with a
BU-353. USB, SiRFstarIII and ARM is not a known-unworkable
configuration.

&gt;<i> I'm having an issue where by the GPSd deamon is not reporting the

I'll get it out of the way now: I don't think it's gpsd's fault
because it works for me. ;)

with that out of the way, let me just say &quot;ick.&quot; That looks some kind
of math or perhaps format string bug. I don't know if that's due to
your math library, your compiler or something internal to gpsd.

I don't think it's gpsd breaking is that gpsd seems to work well on
32-/64-bit machines and big-/little-endian machines. Usually code
that's suffering from all-the-world-is-redhat-x86 syndrome will die
horribly when moved to a sparc64 running openbsd or solaris. Different
word size, alignment, endianness... that's a good way to at least
detect some of the bigger bugs. Not saying it can't happen, I just
don't think that's the primary cause.

&gt;<i> It's also switching through the various 0,2,3 NMEA states very regularly,
</I>&gt;<i> atleast once per second
</I>
What is &quot;it&quot; - your receiver or gpsd? I'm assuming it's gpsd given the
odd output above.

&gt;<i> I've tried lots of difference compilation options, fixing the port speed and
</I>&gt;<i> it makes very little difference.
</I>
Fixed port speed and protocol is a convenience hack, but really it
should be unnecessary.

For testing, can I suggest that you set the receiver to <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-users">NMEA at 4800</A> and
compile with only the NMEA driver and --enable-fixed-speed=4800. That
shouldn't do much, but it will take the binary protocol decoding logic
out of the picture. It'll also help with debugging.

&gt;<i> now, although this isn't the safest way to advertise my location - the data
</I>&gt;<i> coming back from the GPS looks sane
</I>
Thank you. We have dispatched black helicopters to your location. I'm
at 53.5/-113.5 if you want to return fire. :)

Hm. you're only generating GGA, GSA, RMC and GSV. No GLL.

&gt;<i> This output from the ARM platform is very very close to the Fedora Core
</I>&gt;<i> systems.
</I>
You mean that when you look at the raw nmea coming straight out of
ttyUSB0 on both your ARM board and a regular PC, the NMEA looks good,
ie. it's not a serial port problem.

&gt;<i> I stumbled across this:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://sablevm.org/lists/sablevm-bugs/2004-November/000239.html">http://sablevm.org/lists/sablevm-bugs/2004-November/000239.html</A>
</I>&gt;<i> which (although not related to gpsd, has a few pointers for me)
</I>
You might find a few more neat ARM programming tips here...
<A HREF="http://wiki.gp2x.org/wiki/Hardware_Documentation">http://wiki.gp2x.org/wiki/Hardware_Documentation</A>

&gt;<i> I would prefer not to have to recompile everything with -msoft-float unless
</I>&gt;<i> there is really no other way.
</I>
I though ARM didn't have an FPU, so -msoft-float would implicit. From
my gcc manpage:

&quot;-msoft-float changes the calling convention in the output file;
therefore, it is only useful if you compile all of a program with this
option.  In particular, you need to compile libgcc.a, the library that
comes with GCC, with -msoft-float in order for this to work.&quot;

But you knew that - I'm just quoting it for the folks watching this on TV.

Is your compiler providing the math routines, are you using uClinux'
libm to emulate, or are you letting the kernel trap the floating point
stuff? I'm told that at least the 387 FPU was pretty competent; I
don't know about ARM FPU &quot;emulators&quot;.

What compiler and flags are you using? Perhaps you've found a compiler
or optimizer bug.

Are you running in little endian or big endian mode? Generating arm or
thumb instructions?

What do you get back from gpsd if you say &quot;R=1&quot;? It should give you a
stream of synthetic NMEA crafted by gpsd based on its interpretation
of the data from the receiver. How does it compare with &quot;R=2&quot; output,
which is the raw output of the receiver.

You might end up having to slap on a debugger and see exactly what is
mishandling your data.

Sorry I don't have any more concrete answers for you.
