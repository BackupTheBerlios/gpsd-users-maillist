<PRE>Subversion commits are still not working at Berlios.  The problem is
apparently a disk full condition, something so simple to fix that
failure to unwedge since 27 July strongly suggests something
has completely taken out the support organization.

Under these circumstances, I don't think we can count on the Berlios
mailservers continuing to work forever.  I want us to get moved while
they're still up.

Considering desiderata for a new project home, my top criterion is
financial mass of the organization behind it; I don't want to have to
change hosts again because the new one quietly slips underwater as
Berlios seems to have done.  Another constraint is that the new host
needs to be of good repute in the open-source community; I don't need
the political problems I'd get if we tied up (say) with some vendor of
proprietary software.

I'm thinking the leading candidate at this point is Google Code,
especially after this review

	   <A HREF="http://engtech.wordpress.com/2006/07/28/google-code-project-hosting-a-replacement-for-sourceforge/">http://engtech.wordpress.com/2006/07/28/google-code-project-hosting-a-replacement-for-sourceforge/</A>

which makes it clear that they have Subversion hosting.

I'm going to spend some time today trying to extract as much of our
project data from Berlios as I can.  I'm pretty sure I can get our
Subversion archive; the big issue is whether I can extract our
mailing lists and mailing list archives.

Hell of a thing to come up when I'm going on vacation tomorrow...

There's a tendency today to absolve individuals of
moral responsibility and treat them as victims of
social circumstance.  You buy that, you pay with your
soul.
