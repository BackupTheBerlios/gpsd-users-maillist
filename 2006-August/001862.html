<PRE>Hi Eric,

&gt;<i> &gt; I'd also like to find out more about the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; gpsd: can't use GGA/GGL time until after ZDA or RMC has supplied a year.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; message.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That also has nothing to do with your GPGSV problem.  The issue here is that
</I>&gt;<i> GGA and GGL supply a partial timestamp with no year part.  Until a ZDA or
</I>&gt;<i> (more commonly) RMC sentence arrives, the GPS doesn't know what year it is.
</I>
So I guess that gpsd reset's it's notion of what year it is for each
set of messages? I only see it when I use -D2, so it was more a
curiosity. I'm also guessing then that the message about a singularity
is similar.

I haven't started using the libgps yet, but would like to. I find the
flashing/toggling between 3D Fix and No Fix to be a tecnically
correct, annoying as hell from the user perspective thing. For
example, it's impossible to copy and paste the lat and long coordinate
from the screen using the mouse.

If it doesn't already exist, having some type of ability to retrieve a
coherent set of information from the last update, probably triggered
by a change in timestamp, seems like a useful thing to have.

If it's not there, I'll take a stab at implementing it.
