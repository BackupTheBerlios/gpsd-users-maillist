<PRE>My month of August got pretty thoroughly consumed by sword camp, 
LinuxWorld, the World Science Fiction Convention, and meeting with the
Linspire folks to plan a solution to the Linux multimedia problem.

I'm back now, and have checked with my colleagues on the super-duper
hush-hush lawsuit project.  I have to go back to work on that one next
Tuesday.  That gives me six days to do concentrated work on gpsd.

My goal for those six days is to get 2.34 shipped.  The only release
blocker, at this point, is the 'J' patch.  I'm not satisfied with 
either my original patch or Robbin Darroch's attempt.  

I'm working on a third version that drastically simplifies the data
management in gpsd.  Basically, the libgpsd_core.c code will no longer do
fix buffering at all, just report parsed data from GPS packets.  The new
fix-buffering/merge logic will be much simpler, live entirely in gpsd.c,
and merge packets sent up from the the libgpsd_core.c into a per-user
buffer.  

As a side effect, the amount of intermediate storage used by gpsd (and
thus its in-memory footprint) will drop significantly.  I'll be
removing the wired-policy option because it will no longer cut
footprint or cycles enough to bother; the new patch will capture
essaentially all of those gains.

The new patch seems to give good results for a live GPS.

That was the good news.  The bad news is that the new J patch fails the
regression tests.  The problem is not with basic nav data, it's that
the patched version generates different error estimates and I'm not
yet sure why.

It may be that the old estimates were just wrong, that refactoring the
code unmasked a hidden bug related to the way fix data had been being
managed.  Or it may be that I have introduced a bug in the new code.
I'm not sure yet, and won't commit the patch until I am sure.
