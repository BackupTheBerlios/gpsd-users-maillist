To say that a GPS has a fix means that it has computed your position;
sometimes called a navigation solution, or a solution. But &quot;a fix&quot; is
shorter. :)

I had a garmin that could take up to 15 minutes to get a fix when it
had not been used in a while or if I had moved a long distance from
the last place I used it. Perhaps your receiver is just taking a while
to get a fix. I also have a bunch of receivers that advertise a
45second cold-start time: outside my office, with what should be very
good sky view they take closer to 3 minutes to start.

&gt;<i>        n      Get or set the GPS driver mode. Without  argument,

</I>
You compiled gpsd with the default protocol set, right? In your case,
that means that NMEA is enabled, but the Evermore binary protocol is
not. This implies a couple of things:
1) gpsd will not be able to switch the communication protocol to or from binary
2) gpsd will not be able to decode responses from your receiver if
they are in binary mode

That's OK. NMEA generally has all the required information, or enough to matter.

This shouldn't a protocol problem. There are a few of ways you can verify this:
1) use R=2 - this puts your connection into super-raw mode and you
will get a copy of everything the receiver outputs, with no
interpretation. If you connect to my test server (gpsd.mainframe.cx)
and send R=2, you'll get the raw binary stream. The point of this test
is to check that your receiver is sending NMEA.
2) use R=1 - this will ouput a stream of NMEA produced by gpsd. This
NMEA is generated based on what the receiver sends, but is not a
verbatim copy. Assuming valid NMEA comes back, gpsd is able to parse
whatever your receiver is sending.
3) use a program like minicom, cu or tip to connect directly to the
gps and check that NMEA and not the binary protocol is being produced.
4) assuming that this receiver is targetted at windows users with
something like streets&amp;trips, the receiver will default to NMEA

If it turns out that your receiver is sending binary, you should turn
on the Evermore protocol. I'd have to check the commit logs to see why
it's not enabled. Probably lack of testing.

GDB has a 'break' feature; why doesn't it have 'fix' too?
