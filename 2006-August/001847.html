Yes, there is a small problem. The 'xgps' app's main window isn't designed to 
accommodate anything over 14 satellites in the Motif &quot;list&quot; widget. If you 
change the 'MAXCHANNELS' from 14 to 16, it expands the size of the table, 
pushing the data content line off the bottom of the window. That would need 
to be addressed somehow.

We discussed this a bit back when I first pointed out (see 15 Feb 2006 email) 
a discrepancy in the header files that defined 2 versions (12 and 14) of the 
'maximum GPS channel count'.

Back then, we fixed it by bumping it to 14 and fixing 'xgps' widget layout to 
allow that many satellites in the list without messing up the display.

But, as I pointed out back then, 'xgps' is a rather badly-designed Motif 
application and doesn't do widget layout (and other things) quite right. 
Ideally, that satellite list might be a &quot;scrolled window&quot; widget wrapped 
around that &quot;list&quot; widget.

At the time, ESR had this to say:

And I didn't completely disagree with that decision (or I would have politely 
said so :^] ).

However, it may be time to reconsider this, especially in light of this:

Who knows? Some day, maybe even 20 slots may not be enough. It seems clear 
that we need to somehow plan for more than 14 now, though.

P.S. (Side mini-rant): Why do people (e.g. Ville, Eric) omit the timestamp 
from the format for 'Reply-To' in their emails? It makes the content slightly 
less useful with no appreciable gain that I can see. :^(
