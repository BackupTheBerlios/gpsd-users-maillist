<PRE>Hi folks,

Yes, I know it's been a while - I've been really quite flat-out at 
work, and combined with my laptop frying itself a few weeks back, 
that's pretty much reduced my available list-reading/development/etc 
time to zero.  I gather there have been some issues on Berlios 
lately, but one which seems to have started in the past two weeks is 
that my subscription(s) to the mailing list(s) don't seem to be 
working - aside from one message received on 9 August, the last 
messages delivered through the lists were on 1 August, and I see from 
the archives there have been quite a few messages since then.  I've 
tried subscribing with a second e-mail address, to see whether it's 
just a problem with Berlios e-mailing a particular domain.  What 
makes it thoroughly surreal is that I've had a couple of messages 
from the list server complaining that it's had too many bounces to my 
address, but the messages *about* the bounces come through fine (and 
no, these are not the same as the &quot;message undeliverable&quot; virus/spams 
that have hit the list recently).

Anyway, this message is mainly a test to make sure that normal posts 
to the list can still get through to one of my e-mail addresses, and 
also to say that my laptop has been repaired, so hopefully I'll be 
tackling the per-client-session-buffering-option-thing shortly (since 
there have been several more posts about it in the past month or so). 
Have had some ideas about how to implement it relatively efficiently, 
so hopefully it will only take a couple of days once I get my testing 
machine back.

Cheers,
Robin
