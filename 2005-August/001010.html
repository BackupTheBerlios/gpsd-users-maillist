Ordinarily I'd also say this level or error is outrageous.

The difference in this case is that the fix for the problem is an
equation that gives worse answers in the general case and is only
appropriate for short distances.  The question then arises where is
the appropriate point to draw the line and start using the
short-distance approximation?  If we simply want the best answer at
every distance we need to find the cross-over point in accuracy.
(Volunteers?)  Then we need to either find some smooth way to blend
the answers around the cross-over point, or justify ignoring the
issue.

The reason for being concerned about blending the answers is that (in
theory at least) we might have a situation where both equation-A and
equation-B come out with slightly different answers at the cut-over.
A slowly moving object crossing this boundary would then find itself
either hyperspaced forward or backward in distance depending on the
relative answers.  Depending on whether the solutions overlapped or
had an excluded range we'd either have a case where some distances
just couldn't occur, or could occur with two different lat/lon
combinations along the same radial path.  Both of these bother me
quite a bit.  That sort of stuff can lead to really hard to find bugs.

Given that we are talking about GPS applications and the GPS's we have
access to have way more error than 2mm error we probably won't see any
difference in practice.

I think this is a very interesting discussion.  To be honest I'm not
really happy about either choice.  I hate the idea of large errors.  I
just hate the idea of hard to find bugs more.  It would be wonderful
if someone could figure out how to deal with the crossover points so
that things all worked smoothly.
