<PRE>Hello all,

I've found some build bugs that I suspect have been around for a while 
simply because this is not something that normally most anyone would do. 
I found this becasue we tried an old sirf GPS (it's new to us) and it 
sometimes was detected as an fv18 and when that happens you get no 
usable info from the gps. Since I'm critically short of time (I still 
owe some debugging info on a different sirf GPS) I thought I simply turn 
off all binary modes and run NEMA only. Only thing is you can't, gpsd 
will not build, in fact there are several configurations that will not 
build. As a side note, &quot;make clean&quot; was run between all tests.

Finally if someone whats to play the the specific sirf GPS that 
sometimes is detected as a fv18 I have plenty of these and would be 
happy to give one away in hopes of makeing GPSD better. It's an RS-232 
device at normal RS-232 levels and can be connected to a PC with no 
problems.

I'm still trying to get unburied so I can build test the other GPS and 
figure out where the bug cropped up for it.

If you run configure with:
--disable-sirfII
--disable-tsip
--disable-fv18
--disable-tripmate
--disable-earthmate
--disable-garmin

and then try and make gpsd it will fail.

If you enable only sirfII the make will work.
If you enable only tsip the build fails.
If you enable only fv18 the build fails.
If you enable only tripmate the build fails.
If you enable only earthmate the build works.
If you enable only garmin the build works.

I've listed the failure info below for each.

Error output with all binary modes disabled:
