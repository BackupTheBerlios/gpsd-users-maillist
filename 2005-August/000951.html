<PRE>I wanted to release 2.29 Tuesday night, but we've had a flurry of problems
and bug reports that need to be dealt with first.

1. Under unknown circumstances gpsd becomes severly laggy

Andreas Schneider &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-users">mail at cynapses.org</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i>Not only the speed is 10 seconds to late, the postion too. I have updated my
</I>&gt;<i>system clock with ntpdate and compared with the time gpsd reports. The
</I>&gt;<i>difference is 9-12 sec.
</I>
I have not been able to reproduce this. However, I have seen something 
happen on my laptop that could be related.  When I profile on my laptop the
lag between the fix time and when it is delkivered increases slightly every
cycle, as though the daemon can't keep up with the incoming data.  I don't
see this on my desktop machine.

2. The GPS-18 LVC sends GSV parts in random order and sometimes
duplicates them.  As Gary points out, we can get stuff like this:

$GPGSV,3,1,11,02,07,307,00,03,13,114,00,04,09,267,00,08,09,249,00*7F
$GPGSV,3,3,11,24,02,229,00,27,42,260,42,51,00,000,00*41
$GPGSV,3,2,11,13,66,320,49,16,42,059,43,20,28,178,00,23,72,090,50*72
$GPGSV,3,2,11,13,66,320,49,16,42,059,43,20,28,178,00,23,72,090,50*72

The problem is that after the 3rd sentence, there is a count of 11 sats.
When processGSV sees the duplicated sentence it counts past 12, errors
out and clears the data.  This causes xgps to show the sats winking on
and off over many seconds.

The DARPA Grand Challenge guy (Curt, I've never seen his last name) 
is working on a patch that may fix this.  I don't consider it severe
and a fix can wait until after 2.29.

3. Spontaneous closes

Chris Kuethe and Andreas Schneider are reporting an occasional problem
with gpsd spontaneously closing its GPS device. We've managed to show
that it's not happening because all client sessions attached to the
device are shut down.  I have no idea what is going on here.

4. gpsprof -f space is still busted.

Gary Miller has promised to fix it.

5. Trouble with packet_names.h

Several people have reported that it isn't betting automatically rebuilt
when absent.  That always happens here, but other people with the same
or newer versions in their make/automake versions report that they have
to type 'make packet_names.h' to get it.

Alas, I'm basically completely stumped on 1, 3, and 5 because I can't
reproduce them here.
