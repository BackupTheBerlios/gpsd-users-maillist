The code is now in SVN and should make it into the next release.  Curt
really nailed that one.

One side benefit GPS gives you is very accurate time.  Internally the
GPS knows the time to 1 uSec or better.  The problem is how can the GPS
communicate that accurate time it has internally to the host computer in
an accurate manner.

If the GPS just sends the time to the host over a serial channel there
is a large uncertainty added to the time.  RS-232 can only provide you
accurate time stamps to somewhere between 1 Sec and 30 mSec, depending
on your gps model and other factors.  Not good enough.

The long standing and low tech solution is to add a dedicated signal wire
between the GPS and the host.  This dedicated signal is often connected
to the host RS-232 Carrier Detect pin.  All the signal does is pulse
at exactly the top of the second.  Exactly to 1 uS.  So that is why
it is called a PPS (Pulse Per Second).

gpsd can pass that PPS signal on the the commonly used time daemon: ntpd.

When it all is working your host computer clock will then be accurate
and stable to about  +-/1 uSec of UTC.  That is pretty cool for setting
your watch, but it only helps if your GPS outputs this signal.  Consumer
grade GPS usually do not have it, so you have to buy carefully.
