There is no doubt at all that the Haversine Formula gives better
numbers for medium-small values.  And straight Pythagoras with a
cosine(lat) correction gives even better numbers for really small
values.  The question is, does it matter?

Without concrete test cases it is impossible to tell if there is a
real problem.  Engineering annals are filled with amusing (and sad)
stories of folks so worried about a theoretical problem that they
introduced other far worse problems into a design.

&gt;<i> It isn't an issue of trying to do these calcs with a deficient
</I>&gt;<i> floating point unit.  As the subtended angle approaches zero the
</I>&gt;<i> (sine?cosine?) approaches infinity.  Right?
</I>
You might be thinking of different trig functions, but the point is
well taken.* If you subtract two big numbers that both have a bit of
fluff in their LSB's you can end up with the case that the fluff
becomes much more important.  One does have to test it though to make
sure it has become important enough to worry about.

&gt;<i> I remember having to use haversine equations for that reason.  I got
</I>&gt;<i> them from &quot;Guide to the practical Navigator (Bowditch).

Good book.  

It is available for free download in pdf form. Support the publisher
if you can though.  They've been awfully nice to make the book
available like this.

*) Well, the &quot;sine&quot; waves coming out of this crappy UPS sitting next
   to me might reach infinity near zero crossings, but that's an
   entirely different issue. ;-)
