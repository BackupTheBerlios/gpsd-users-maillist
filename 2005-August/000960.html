&gt;<i>I wanted to release 2.29 Tuesday night, but we've had a flurry of problems

</I>&gt;<i>1. Under unknown circumstances gpsd becomes severly laggy
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Andreas Schneider &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-users">mail at cynapses.org</A>&gt;:
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>Not only the speed is 10 seconds to late, the postion too. I have updated my
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>system clock with ntpdate and compared with the time gpsd reports. The
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>difference is 9-12 sec.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I have not been able to reproduce this. However, I have seen something 
</I>&gt;<i>happen on my laptop that could be related.  When I profile on my laptop the
</I>&gt;<i>lag between the fix time and when it is delkivered increases slightly every
</I>&gt;<i>cycle, as though the daemon can't keep up with the incoming data.  I don't
</I>&gt;<i>see this on my desktop machine.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>If the socket communication between gpsd and ntp is using blocking read 
then data can get backed up in the socket if it is not emptied fast 
enough on the reader side. I don't know if I am describing this well 
enough, but basically the ntp daemon needs to open it's socket with the 
non-block flag set. Before it reads data from gpsd it should flush the 
stale data in the socket and wait for  a fresh sentence.

The error will become bigger or the back log greater on slow machines or 
machines with high loads.

Also if this is the problem, a bad route table could cause things to be 
ineffecient.

&gt;<i>2. The GPS-18 LVC sends GSV parts in random order and sometimes
</I>&gt;<i>duplicates them.  As Gary points out, we can get stuff like this:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>$GPGSV,3,1,11,02,07,307,00,03,13,114,00,04,09,267,00,08,09,249,00*7F
</I>&gt;<i>$GPGSV,3,3,11,24,02,229,00,27,42,260,42,51,00,000,00*41
</I>&gt;<i>$GPGSV,3,2,11,13,66,320,49,16,42,059,43,20,28,178,00,23,72,090,50*72
</I>&gt;<i>$GPGSV,3,2,11,13,66,320,49,16,42,059,43,20,28,178,00,23,72,090,50*72
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>The problem is that after the 3rd sentence, there is a count of 11 sats.
</I>&gt;<i>When processGSV sees the duplicated sentence it counts past 12, errors
</I>&gt;<i>out and clears the data.  This causes xgps to show the sats winking on
</I>&gt;<i>and off over many seconds.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>The DARPA Grand Challenge guy (Curt, I've never seen his last name) 
</I>&gt;<i>is working on a patch that may fix this.  I don't consider it severe
</I>&gt;<i>and a fix can wait until after 2.29.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I guess I should chime in here. My name is Curt Meyers, sorry I never 
disclosed it before. I use a series of random email address that I 
create under my own domain to fight spam. That is why this email comes 
from the generic name &quot;maillist&quot;.

About the GSV problem. I had a &quot;hack&quot; fix that I sent to Eric related to 
this problem but it didn't quite cut the mustard. I didn't have time to 
do regression testing and Eric said it breaks a bunch of things, that I 
believe.

Basically there are two possible problems as I see it.

1. You haven't updated to get the latest changes made to packet.c where 
incoming packets can get totally lost. I you have looked at the output 
of your device using a terminal program (I use minicom) and always see 
all the GSV messages in order then this is the fix to your problem. 
Essentially gpsd is dropping packets randomly but you only notice the 
problem with GSV because this causes gpsd to abort due to the mistmatch 
sattelite count.

2. You device does output messages in a random way (which is a bit hard 
to believe but I will go with it for now) and you need the change that I 
attempted to make to the nmea_parse.c code. Essentially what this does 
it look at the fields 1, 2, and 3 and uses those to stuff the internal 
structure with the sattelite stats. What gpsd currently does it reset a 
sattelite counter when it sees the first sentence (starts with 3,1 
above) and just counts up from there. In the above sample the first 
sentence resets the counter. The second sentence increments us to +3 for 
a total of 7, the third +4 for a total of 11 and the last +4 for a total 
of  15.  The limit right now is 12 so this causes the error.

I have a receiver that receives up to 14 sattelites so that there is 
still another problem but you probably won't see that.

&gt;<i>3. Spontaneous closes
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Chris Kuethe and Andreas Schneider are reporting an occasional problem
</I>&gt;<i>with gpsd spontaneously closing its GPS device. We've managed to show
</I>&gt;<i>that it's not happening because all client sessions attached to the
</I>&gt;<i>device are shut down.  I have no idea what is going on here.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>This is probably related to item #2. You should run gpsd with some level 
of datalogging. Like &quot;-D 5&quot; with output a lot of information. If it is 
related to #2 above it might crash on a GSV sentence. What is 
interesting is that with more debug information printing out it seems to 
be more likely to crash. Try it at level 5 and it might crash pretty quick.

Also try loading up the machine when you are testing it. I did a lot of 
disk thrashing to create a lot of IO to provoke my failures.

&gt;<i>4. gpsprof -f space is still busted.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Gary Miller has promised to fix it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>5. Trouble with packet_names.h
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Several people have reported that it isn't betting automatically rebuilt
</I>&gt;<i>when absent.  That always happens here, but other people with the same
</I>&gt;<i>or newer versions in their make/automake versions report that they have
</I>&gt;<i>to type 'make packet_names.h' to get it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Alas, I'm basically completely stumped on 1, 3, and 5 because I can't
</I>&gt;<i>reproduce them here.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
