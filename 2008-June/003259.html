Well, assuming you want to use gpsd to help you out, I think there are
three basic chunks to this task.

1) Get your GPS receiver connected and talking to your computer.
2) Get gpsd talking to your GPS receiver.
3) Write your program to talk to gpsd and parse its output.

Step 1 varies depending on your specific hardware.  In general, you will
probably be plugging your GPS into a serial port, or a USB or Bluetooth
emulation of a serial port.  You will also have to arrange for your GPS
to get power somehow: via USB, via a connection to your system's power
supply, whatever.

Once you have this connection made, and you know (or suspect) which
serial port device in Linux corresponds to the place you plugged it in
(/dev/ttyS0, /dev/ttyUSB1, etc) you can fire up a terminal program like
minicom and point it at that device.  With the terminal program adjusted
to the right bit rate, data bits, stop bits, parity, etc, you should
see *something* coming from the GPS.  If you never get anything, you may
be on the wrong port, or your GPS may need to be &quot;woken up&quot; in some way.
If the GPS is in NMEA mode, the data you see will be mostly-human-
readable ASCII strings; if the GPS has an antenna with enough sky view,
you will probably be able to recognize numbers close to your actual
latitude, longitude, and altitude (in meters) in one of the strings.

Once you are happy with Step 1, Step 2 involves getting gpsd running on
your system.  If you are using a Linux distribution like Debian, Red
Hat, etc, it may already be available as a pre-compiled package; if not
you'll have to download the gpsd source and compile it.  Once you have
the gpsd executable, you run it, telling it which port your GPS device
is on (the same one from step 1).  It should find your GPS and
auto-negotiate the best communication mode that your GPS is capable of;
gpsd will write debugging messages to the system log and/or the screen
(depending on command-line options) to help you see what it's doing.

Once gpsd has reported some kind of success, you should be able to
telnet in to port 2947, issue gpsd commands, and get some kind of
response from gpsd.  If your GPS can see enough satellites, the 'o'
command should give you a current position report.

Step 3 is mostly your baby, once Steps 1 and 2 are complete.  You might
read <A HREF="http://gpsd.berlios.de/faq.html">http://gpsd.berlios.de/faq.html</A> , in particular &quot;How should I
interface my application with gpsd?&quot;  That entry links to
<A HREF="http://gpsd.berlios.de/libgps.html">http://gpsd.berlios.de/libgps.html</A> which has a (very simplified) C code
example.  Basically, the calls to gpsd will fill in members of a
gps_fix_t structure, which you can then read and act on.

Other random tips:

If there's any possible way to do it, arrange for your GPS to have an
antenna that can see satellites.  Sometimes this is as simple as putting
the antenna out on your windowsill; sometimes you have to run half a
mile of cable to the surface from your secure underground bunker.  The
reason is that the responses from the GPS will be minimal until it sees
some satellites; these minimal responses are enough to verify that the
GPS isn't totally dead, but it's hard to go much beyond that.  If you
can't yet pick up the whole embedded system and carry it around outside,
you might also see if you can at least carry the antenna around outside;
this will cause the GPS to report movement, which is probably the main
thing you're interested in in your program.

If your GPS connects via serial/USB/Bluetooth, and if your embedded
system is difficult to develop on (for instance: you only have a 300 bps
serial console to it, or you have to burn all the code into EPROM and
then try it and see), it might be faster to develop some of the code on
a normal desktop PC, running Linux, with your GPS plugged into it.  On
your desktop, you can pop another xterm to read the documentation, go
check the gpsd web site, fire off an email if you're really stuck, etc.
