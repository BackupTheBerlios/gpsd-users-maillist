<PRE>&gt;<i> David I S Mandala &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-users">davidm at them.com</A>&gt;:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It's been my experience that zero-config is a dream and I've never
</I>seen
&gt;<i> &gt; it work in the real world 100%. Certainly the current gpsd fails to
</I>auto
&gt;<i> &gt; config the serial speed correctly and detection of gps type for some
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; gps's.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For which ones is this currently a problem?
</I>
My etrex venture. I can run your gpsd 2.3 and it won't autobaud to 4800
for well over 30 minutes. Having to run some other command first to set
the baud because gpsd doesn't give a simple baud command line option is
unacceptable. It just shows that gpsd isn't simple and easy to use.

A little advice on all &quot;auto&quot; settings, keep the autobaud logic, that's
great to make something that can be smart enough to figure it out. *But*
give a command line option to force certain settings for times when auto
doesn't work (like now).

I'm wondering if there isn't some other &quot;auto&quot; problem that is biting
me. I've checked and re-checked all my kismet settings, it connects to
gpsd (I see it saying it's connected up) but doesn't ever record any
gps. OTOH when I run gpsdrive which runs an older non-auto version of
gpsd it gets coordinates just fine. I can exit gpsdrive after it's been
working and fire up gpsd (with the correct baud) and kismet and watch no
gps come across.

There are only two things I can think of that would cause this behavior.
The newer gpsd has lost some logic that the older gpsd had that made it
work correctly or kismet can't handle the &quot;garmin&quot; coordinates and
gpsdrive can.

Any suggestions on debugging the gpsd/kismet problem to figure out where
it's breaking?

Thanks!
