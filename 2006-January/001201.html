<PRE>I have searched and search for an answer to this, with no results.

I am using gpsd-2.30 on a Slackware 10.2 system. The gps is a Trimble
Lassen IQ module on a breakout board with two ports. The first port is
set to output tsip and the second port is set to output NMEA. The
interface to the computer is via a Prolific USB-2-Serial adapter using
the module from my kernel which is v2.6.14.4. I have tried using both
the tsip port (1) and the NMEA port (2).

The problem is that during use I do not receive information updates
on the tsip port. I have tried using the NMEA port but I only get
position (lat/long) data. No time, no status, nothing but lat/long.
Yet the NMEA data does update. It is just the tsip data that does not.

To trouble shoot this I have run gpsd with the following command:

 gpsd -nN -D 5 /dev/ttyUSB0

and watched the stream. At the same time I open a terminal and poll
the simplest thing to check (for me at least) which is the time. I
have read part of Trimble's tsip reference manual and found the time
packet as 0x41. While this value in the debug info is constantly
incramented, polling gpsd via a &quot;telnet localhost 2947&quot; for &quot;D&quot; always
returns the time that gpsd was started. The other data, such as
position and so on also remain at the values that were given when gpsd
was started.

As I mentioned I have searched through alot of information. I have
read the archives (searched through actualy) ofthis list as well as
searched on google and a few others for varius keywords with no
results. Only a few stating tsip has/had an error with velocity/mode.

I can post a segment of the output from a &quot;-Dx&quot; or from a telnet
session if required. Just let me know what level you want.

Thanks

James
