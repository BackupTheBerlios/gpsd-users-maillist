<PRE>Happy new year everyone!

I'm continuing work on a gpsd-to-Google Earth real-time translator, 
and it's working pretty well so far.  However, I kept getting &quot;Broken 
Pipe&quot; messages, and by testing with other gpsd clients (including 
straight telnet sessions) I've found a bug in gpsd 2.30 itself. 
Given the additional problems in versions between 2.25 and 2.30 I 
haven't rebuilt all the intervening versions to see when the bug 
first appeared, but I don't believe I had seen this problem in 2.25 
(which was the last version I used for a substantial period of time). 
Although I'll share the full source code for my &quot;gpstoge&quot; program 
shortly, the part that interfaces with gpsd is as follows:


	gps1 = gps_open(server,port);
	gps_query(gps1, &quot;o\n&quot;);
	sleep(1);

	for (;;) {

		gps_query(gps1, &quot;o\n&quot;);


		sleep(3);
	}

	gps_close(gps1);

The first &quot;o&quot; query is just to make sure that gpsd is awake, then 
after that an &quot;o&quot; query is sent every three seconds without fail. 
Another program I use - KisMAC - sends a query every second or two 
also... and yet it will regularly report that gpsd 2.30 has closed 
the connection.

Although I've coded gpstoge to work around the problem (by closing 
and reopening the connection if it doesn't get a successful result 
from gps_query), this shouldn't really be necessary if gpsd can be 
persuaded not to close active connections.  So, what is gpsd 
reporting?  Well, there's the curious part:

[whole bunch of normal debug output, then...]
GPS sent 1 new characters
&lt;= GPS: $GPRMC,004952.747,A,2022.6884,S,11837.9725,E,0.000000,,040106,,*08
gpsd: polling 5
Read 1 chars to buffer offset 0 (total 1): 24
00197365: character '$' [24], new state: NMEA_DOLLAR
GPS sent 1 new characters
New data, not yet a packet
gpsd: client(4) timed out on command wait.
gpsd: detaching 4 in detach_client
gpsd: unflagging descriptor 5 in open_device
closing GPS=/dev/cu.usbserial0 (5)

So... it claims to be timing out &quot;on command wait&quot;.

Further debugging has shown that it is reaching the limit for the 
difference between &quot;subscribers[cfd].active&quot; and &quot;timestamp()&quot;, so 
I've investigated what is happening to &quot;.active&quot;... and it appears 
the answer is &quot;nothing&quot;.  Well, that's not entirely true.  It's 
assigned the current timestamp when the client first connects, but it 
is not updated at all regardless of client activity, so - as it has 
been coded to do - it will drop the connection when a given client, 
regardless of activity, has been connected continuously for 
POLLER_TIMEOUT.

I believe the idea should be to disconnect a client only if it has 
been *inactive* for that long, so I've added a line in gpsd.c to 
update .active every time it actually sends information to the client:

10:28 [~/src/gpsd-2.30] robin&gt; diff -u gpsd-orig.c gpsd.c
--- gpsd-orig.c 2006-01-04 10:25:48.000000000 +0800

                 } else {
                     buf[buflen] = '\0';
                     gpsd_report(1, &quot;&lt;= client(%d): %s&quot;, cfd, buf);
-
+                       // added to prevent timeouts
+                       subscribers[cfd].active = timestamp();
+
  #ifdef RTCM104_SERVICE
                     if (subscribers[cfd].rtcm) {
                         if (handle_dgpsip_request(cfd, buf, buflen) &lt; 0)

I've tested this using both my gpstoge client, and telnet sessions 
(one in watcher mode, and another with a query or two and then idle). 
The idle session is disconnected as it should be, but the others 
remain active.

One bug squashed!

Cheers,
Robin

P.S.  When I do reach a point of deciding that gpstoge is ready to 
go, what is the best way to share it with others on this list?
