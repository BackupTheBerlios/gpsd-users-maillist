<PRE>&gt;<i> &gt; Also, two things would be nice for gpxlogger to have:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a) better command line parsing: &quot;gpxlogger --help&quot; currently starts 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; logging to a file called &quot;--help&quot;. argh.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> yeah, the thing is currently particularly brain dead ;D
</I>
here is some command line parsing code I wrote for a simple client,

        if(argc &gt; 3) {
                printf(&quot;Usage: gpsdlog [-q] time_interval\n   default 10 (sec), non-quiet\n&quot;);
                exit(1);
        }

        for(i=1; i&lt;3; i++) {
            if(i &gt;= argc) continue;

            if( strcmp(argv[i],&quot;-q&quot;) == 0 ) {
                quiet_mode = 1;
                continue;
            }
            if(1 == sscanf(argv[i], &quot;%d&quot;, &amp;interval))
                continue;
            /* shouldn't get this far */
            printf(&quot;Usage: gpsdlog [-q] time_interval\n   default: 10 (sec), non-quiet\n&quot;);
            exit(1);
        }

        fprintf(stderr, &quot;time interval is %d seconds\n&quot;, interval);


I don't claim it is very good, but you are welcome to it if you think it
would be useful for gpxlogger.


&gt;<i> &gt; Also, two things would be nice for gpxlogger to have:
</I>..
&gt;<i> &gt; b) a command line option to set the time between trackpoints.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Currently gpxlogger logs every positon that comes through which
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; leads to HUGE log  files if you leave it running for hours at a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; time. It takes only a few  minutes to get to 100k.. For me, anything
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; less than every 10 sec is  overkill. It should still retain
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; tracklimit test though, even if that  limit is shorter than the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; logging interval.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> yeah, I can understand your point, however
</I>&gt;<i> * gzipping the file will reduce it by a large amount
</I>
Yes, but, I don't need or want the extra data. Also I log for weeks at a
time, and don't want to have to resort to cron jobs to stop, gzip, &amp; 
restart the file &amp; break the track to do that every hour. Only once a day.
:<i>)
</I>
Logging is on a solid-state MiniITX logger to a compact flash
filesystem. Resources are limited.


&gt;<i> * doing that when going at highway speeds will lead to something 
</I>&gt;<i> like a point every 500m or so, which is not acceptable
</I>
I ask for it to be an optional setting, the default could still be to 
log every fix.

Logging every 10 sec may not be appropriate for car/street use, but in 
my case I am logging the position of a ship at sea where the turn time
is slow enough that I can interpolate position very well between two
track points. Besides, my other equipment is only sampling data every
ten seconds, and it is that data which I want to geo-locate. :)
The less post-processing I have to do the better. :)


&gt;<i> a better idea I guess would be to depend on zlib and use it on the fly
</I>
That makes it overly complicated IMO. Personally, I would prefer to log 
to a text file and have a cron script break &amp; gzip it. It makes `tail -f`
type checking all the more difficult..

 
&gt;<i> &gt; Similar to above, add a new timestamp call when a track point is 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; written and then before track point write, add
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; if (fabs(gpsfix.time - timestamp) &gt; dt) {
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> hmm, I fail to understand that one ;D
</I>
More refined: logging every 10sec, or perhaps easier to understand at 
30sec and 60sec intervals, it would be nice if it waited for the first
fix to come after the start of each (10sec) epoch, and then didn't 
write to file again until the next epoch is reached. i.e. the output
fixes happen on the &quot;round&quot; clicks of the clock. e.g. for 1 minute 
sampling when the logging started at 0:42, the position would be 
recorded near 1:00, 2:00, 3:00  not 0:42, 1:42, 2:42.

New time_t epoch_timestamp and int epoch_hit variables needed. Test &amp; 
set against current gpsfix.time before each fprintf(track point).


thanks,
Hamish
