Although some people are convinced it is the placement of the antenna,
I'm not.

If you get a 250ms delay, something else must be wrong than a signal
bounce.

For the GPS to mistake its position by 250ms, it would need a bounce
from something 300000km/s * 0.25s / 2 = 37000km away. If you mistakenly
place your GPS on the roof instead of the towbar, I have to say, cars
just aren't that big. (I know cars in America are generally bigger
than here in Europe, but not /that/ big... :-) )

The USB transport is not suited for anything time-related that
requires sub-millisecond accuracy. If an USB-connected GPS unit wants
to tell the computer it's 12:23:45, it will have to wait for the
computer to poll it. This polling happens 1000 times per second. So
this is a fundamental issue with USB devices as a time-standard.

The USB chip might run at anything close to 1000 Hz. If it runs at
1000.1 Hz, every 10th second the next time-report will come 1
whole millisecond earlier. This will have NTP observing something
like a 1 ms high sawtooth in the time-reports.

Now, the 250ms sounds to me as something weird is happening. Something
like transmission errors on the USB. In any case, it is highly
unlikely that a GPS unit itself is 250ms confused about the
real-time-clock. If that were the case, it would incur about 75000km
errors on it's location, which we know is not happening....
