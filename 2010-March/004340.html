&gt;<i> As the ntpq shows, you are locked on to SHM(1) which is your gpsd/PPS. That
</I>&gt;<i> is  about 1mS from ntp1.sp.se.  Unless you have been running on PPS for
</I>&gt;<i> several days and you are really close to ntp1.sp.se, I would just leave
</I>&gt;<i> that alone.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You can also see that SHM(0) which is your TSIP decoded time is off about
</I>&gt;<i> 445mS.  First I would see how &quot;time1 0&quot; works for you and adjust until
</I>&gt;<i> you are happy.  Given the jitter on the serial time you can not expect to
</I>&gt;<i> dial it in better than about +/- 200mS.
</I>
As you have a PPS signal, I'd propose to remove the SHM(0) entry 
completely from the ntp.conf file, as the serial times basically always 
also are much worse than the time provided over the network.  Better to 
put in one or other more network time source.  This is possible as recent 
versions of gpsd no longer relies on the feedback-loop of gpsd -&gt; SHM(0) 
-&gt; ntpd -&gt; semi-correct computer-time -&gt; gpsd -&gt; SHM(1) but handles this 
internally to combine the serial time messages and the PPS pulses and 
gives accurate SHM(1) by itself.

I'd propose to change the documentation to say that once one sees that the 
SHM(1) / PPS is working, one should remove SHM(0) from the ntp.conf file.

Cheers,
H&#229;kan
