</I>&gt;<i> &gt;I've discovered USB GPS dongles are pretty terrible for usage with ntpd for any sort of time sync. It's not the delay, it's too much random jitter. The offset spans the range of -250ms to +250ms
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You will get jitter with these because of the lack of a decent
</I>&gt;<i> antenna and the height above the ground.  If you go to a different
</I>&gt;<i> make &amp; model of GPS with the same antenna issues you'll just have
</I>&gt;<i> the same problem.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I have one external USB GPS that gives me a lot of position and time
</I>&gt;<i> jitter, but another one has an antenna jack to which I've cabled a
</I>&gt;<i> length of co-ax cable running to a dedicated Garmin GPS antenna at
</I>&gt;<i> the back of the boat.  That gives me much better accuracy (my boat
</I>&gt;<i> is not &quot;inland&quot; quite so often according to the traces) and much
</I>&gt;<i> less jitter.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> One common misconception / fault is to place the GPS antenna as high
</I>&gt;<i> as possible.  This is wrong, and causes signal bounce from the
</I>&gt;<i> ground / water, which causes the GPS to mistake its position and
</I>&gt;<i> time signal.  The correct location for the GPS antenna is on the
</I>&gt;<i> gunwale rail or pushpit rail, close to the water &amp; as far from the
</I>&gt;<i> mast as possible (to reduce signal bounce from the mast).  If you're
</I>&gt;<i> in a car, don't put the GPS antenna on the roof, put it on the
</I>&gt;<i> towbar or similar.  If you're outside or in a fixed location, put
</I>&gt;<i> the GPS antenna as far from buildings as possible, and on the
</I>&gt;<i> ground.  Accept the fact that if you're driving in a heavily built
</I>&gt;<i> up area you're going to get signal bounce and lack of accuracy.  My
</I>&gt;<i> in car GPS beeped at me last week because it thought I was
</I>&gt;<i> travelling at 15000 km/hr.
</I>
This seemed so helpful that I have attempted to turn it into a FAQ entry.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;h1 id='accuracy'&gt;How can I improve fix and PPS time accuracy from my GPS&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use an antenna, and place the sensor (and/or antenna) properly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A real antenna can help, especially if you're using PPS as a time
reference. It should be particularly helpful for reducing timing
jitter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One common error is to place the GPS or antenna as high as possible.
This is wrong, and causes signal bounce from the ground or water,
which can causes the GPS to mistake its position and the time signal.
The correct location for a boat GPS antenna is on the gunwale rail or
pushpit rail, close to the water and as far from the mast as possible
(to reduce signal bounce from the mast).  If you're in a car, don't
put the GPS antenna on the roof, put it on the towbar or similar.  If
you're outside or in a fixed location, put the GPS antenna as far from
buildings as possible, and on the ground./&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're driving in a heavily built up area, you're going to get
signal bounce and reduced accuracy. That's just how the physics
works.&lt;/p&gt;
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Comments and improvements welcome.
