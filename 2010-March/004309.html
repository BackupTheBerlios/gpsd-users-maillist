You will get jitter with these because of the lack of a decent antenna and the height above the 
ground.  If you go to a different make &amp; model of GPS with the same antenna issues you'll just 
have the same problem.

I have one external USB GPS that gives me a lot of position and time jitter, but another one 
has an antenna jack to which I've cabled a length of co-ax cable running to a dedicated Garmin 
GPS antenna at the back of the boat.  That gives me much better accuracy (my boat is not 
&quot;inland&quot; quite so often according to the traces) and much less jitter.

One common misconception / fault is to place the GPS antenna as high as possible.  This is 
wrong, and causes signal bounce from the ground / water, which causes the GPS to mistake its 
position and time signal.  The correct location for the GPS antenna is on the gunwale rail or 
pushpit rail, close to the water &amp; as far from the mast as possible (to reduce signal bounce 
from the mast).  If you're in a car, don't put the GPS antenna on the roof, put it on the 
towbar or similar.  If you're outside or in a fixed location, put the GPS antenna as far from 
buildings as possible, and on the ground.  Accept the fact that if you're driving in a heavily 
built up area you're going to get signal bounce and lack of accuracy.  My in car GPS beeped at 
me last week because it thought I was travelling at 15000 km/hr.
