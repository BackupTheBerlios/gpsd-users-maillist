Wikipedia's article on GPS confirms that multipath effects due to 
near reflectors can be significant. I found these paragraphs most
informative:

    GPS signals can also be affected by multipath issues, where the radio
    signals reflect off surrounding terrain; buildings, canyon walls, hard
    ground, etc. These delayed signals can cause inaccuracy. A variety of
    techniques, most notably narrow correlator spacing, have been
    developed to mitigate multipath errors. For long delay multipath, the
    receiver itself can recognize the wayward signal and discard it. To
    address shorter delay multipath from the signal reflecting off the
    ground, specialized antennas (e.g., a choke ring antenna) may be used
    to reduce the signal power as received by the antenna. Short delay
    reflections are harder to filter out because they interfere with the
    true signal, causing effects almost indistinguishable from routine
    fluctuations in atmospheric delay.

    Multipath effects are much less severe in moving vehicles. When the
    GPS antenna is moving, the false solutions using reflected signals
    quickly fail to converge and only the direct signals result in stable
    solutions.

Note the reference to &quot;hard ground&quot; - by which I think is actually
meant an abrupt density transition, so ocean surface in relatively
calm conditions would qualify. This, and the reference to specialized
antennas, validates the notion that antenna conformation and placement
actually matters.

&gt;<i> If you get a 250ms delay, something else must be wrong than a signal
</I>&gt;<i> bounce.

On the other hand, I agree with this, too.

Good analysis.  Here's how I have a FAQ entries on accuracy cutrrently
reading:

&lt;h1 id='accuracy'&gt;How can I improve fix accuracy from my GPS?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use an antenna, and place the sensor (and/or antenna) properly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A real antenna can help, especially if you're using PPS as a time
reference. It should be particularly helpful for reducing timing
jitter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One common error is to place the GPS or antenna as high as
possible.  This will increase &lt;a
href=&quot;<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Positioning_System#Multipath_effects">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Positioning_System#Multipath_effects</A>&quot;&gt;multipath
effects&lt;/a&gt; due to signal bounce from the ground or water, which can
cause the GPS to mistake its position and the time signal.  The
correct location for a boat GPS antenna is on the gunwale rail or
pushpit rail, close to the water and as far from the mast as possible
(to reduce signal bounce from the mast). If
you're outside or in a fixed location, put the GPS antenna as far from
buildings as possible, and on the ground. If you're in a car, don't
put the GPS antenna on the roof, put it on the towbar or similar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're driving in a heavily built up area, you're going to get
signal bounce off buildings and and reduced accuracy. That's just how
the physics works. Note, however, that as your velocity goes up it
becomes easier for the convergence filters in your GPS to spot
and discard delayed signal, so multipath effects are proprtionately
less important in fast-moving vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're using &lt;tt&gt;gpsd&lt;/tt&gt; with software that plots your
position on a map, and you seem to be getting latitude/longitude that
is at a fixed offset from reality, it is possible the base datum of
the map is something other than the WGS84 GPS uses. A
frequently-occuring case of this is older maps in the United States
based on NAD27 (e.g., USGS topo maps); you may see a displacement of
as much as 100-150m with respect to WGS84.  While modern datums (e.g.,
NAD83) are almost all very close to WGS84, typically each area of
world has an older datum that only agrees at the 100m level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id='time'&gt;How can I improve time reference accuracy from my GPS?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the measures you'd take to improve &lt;a href=&quot;#accuracy&quot;&gt;fix
accuracy&lt;/a&gt; will help. Time referencing at accuracies below 
0.01sec has its own set of issues related to latency in your
sensor and computer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In particular, USB transport is not suited for anything
time-related that requires sub-millisecond accuracy. If a
USB-connected GPS unit wants to tell the computer it's 12:23:45, it
will have to wait for the computer to poll it. This polling happens
1000 times per second, introducing variable latency averaging a
half-millisecond.  Furthermore, the USB chip might run at anything
close to 1000 Hz. If it runs at 1000.1 Hz, every 10th second the next
time-report will come 1 whole millisecond earlier. This will have NTP
observing something like a 1 ms high sawtooth in the time-reports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For accurate time reference, use a PPS line over RS232 triggering an
interrupt. Serial bus interrupt latencies on modern hardware on the
order of 10 microseconds, roughly a hundred-fold impovement over
USB.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don't confuse PPS with conventianal, non-PPS data transport over RS232;
the latency on that is much higher. At one character per ten bits
(counting framing at stopbits) a 9600-bps serial link introduces
about a millisecond of latency &lt;em&gt;per character&lt;/em&gt;; both USB and
RS232 will incur that overhead.&lt;/p&gt;
