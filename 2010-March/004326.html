<PRE>
&gt;<i> I am not clear on the antenna patterns of cheap GPS receivers.  With a
</I>&gt;<i> patch antenna on a magnetic mount on horizontal metal, it's hard to see
</I>&gt;<i> how there would be much gain in the arrival direction of signals
</I>&gt;<i> reflecting from the ground.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> When I've seen multipath problems, it's been in the city where there are
</I>&gt;<i> a lot of tall buildings; the signal from a satellite can arrive bounced
</I>&gt;<i> off a building (and thus a longer path length than it should) combined
</I>&gt;<i> with the original being blocked.
</I>
As mentioned I have certainly seen multipath problems with antennas 
located too high from the ground.  Admittedly this was something like 
15m from the ground rather than the 2m that would be the height of a 
car, but there were no tall buildings around.

If you trawl through various marine electronic equipment manuals you 
will find that most of them advise against siting the GPS antenna high 
on a sailing vessel.  If you visit various sailing forums and read 
enough sailing magazines then in amongst the clutter (usually &quot;my GPS is 
useless because it gave me a 10 meter positional error once last 
September so now I only use a sextant and compass&quot; -- one wonders how 
many amateur sailors can produce a fix within 10m using sextant and 
compass) you'll find other more rational information from GPS users 
reporting problems with antennas sited high in the rigging or on top of 
the mast.  This is certainly anecdotal at best, and some of it may be 
due to factors other than signal bounce, and the signal bounce may be 
due to factors other than the height of the antenna.  There are 
certainly problems due to signal loss through cable joins, the length of 
cable involved, poor quality cable, poor quality cable joins, and the 
inevitable problem at sea being corroded cable &amp; joins, but some of it 
is most likely due to actual real signal bounce caused by the antenna 
being located too high or otherwise in an inappropriate location.

&gt;<i>    I have one external USB GPS that gives me a lot of position and time
</I>&gt;<i>    jitter, but another one has an antenna jack to which I've cabled a
</I>&gt;<i>    length of co-ax cable running to a dedicated Garmin GPS antenna at the
</I>&gt;<i>    back of the boat.  That gives me much better accuracy (my boat is not
</I>&gt;<i>    &quot;inland&quot; quite so often according to the traces) and much less jitter.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That doesn't support your theory, because the alternate hypothesis that
</I>&gt;<i> one device is junk and the other one, combined with an actual antenna is
</I>&gt;<i> good seems a far more likely explanation.  To test the theory, you'd
</I>&gt;<i> have to put the same antenna in multiple places.
</I>
I've tried the same antenna in multiple places trick, admittedly on a 
different GPS (navman, not a garmin) and seen signal bounce in one 
antenna site and not another.

The point I was making above wasn't related to the earlier discussion of 
signal bounce, but I was trying to point out the fact that a better 
antenna == a better signal == better accuracy.  The USB GPS that I have 
has an internal antenna that it will use if there is nothing plugged 
into the antenna jack.  With the antenna plugged in I get much less 
positional jitter than with no antenna.  I can't measure how much of 
this is due to signal bounce or interference, most of it is probably due 
to better reception with the external antenna.  However I do strongly a 
much better signal with the external antenna, simply because one antenna 
is inside a steel boat and one antenna is outside it.

&gt;<i> So the advice I'd give is:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For best performance, try to place the antenna so that it has an
</I>&gt;<i> unobstructed view of as much of the sky as possible.  Secondarily, be
</I>&gt;<i> aware of the possibility of multipath reception of signals via
</I>&gt;<i> reflections from the vehicle or the environment and try to place the
</I>&gt;<i> antenna to minimize those reflections.  Keep in mind that the key points
</I>&gt;<i> in avoiding problems due to multipath are having many signals received
</I>&gt;<i> without multipath (because the computed position uses many satellites)
</I>&gt;<i> and having as many signals as possible with the direct path being
</I>&gt;<i> stronger than the reflected path.
</I>
I would support that.  There are certainly many factors that can produce 
GPS errors of various sorts.  Signal bounce is one of those factors. 
There are many factors that can produce signal bounce, and the siting of 
the aerial within a vehicle or vessel is one of those.

I'm not formally trained in RF electronics but I've been doing amateur 
marine electronics for a number of years.  In that time, believe me, 
I've seen some bizarre stuff.  That includes everything from a VHF radio 
antenna inside a locked steel box (&quot;I was wondering why I never got any 
signal on that radio&quot;) to a fluxgate (electronic compass normally 
attached to an autopilot) mounted alongside the engine (&quot;It's odd that 
this autopilot never seems to hold a course properly while the engine's 
running&quot;).  So I'm always highly skeptical when someone asserts that 
electronic equipment issues are definitely due to some particular factor 
or another, but in this case I've certainly seen sufficient issues 
related to location of GPS antennas and heard sufficient second hand 
reports to make me strongly suspect signal bounce to be one possible 
issue in many cases, even if I don't have the empirical evidence for it.
