<PRE>Back in January I posted a work-around for a problem I've had with
gpsd not reporting a position after I upgraded to Fedora Core 12,
namely to add some blanks to the print &quot;p\n&quot; statement sent to gpsd.
This worked at home for me in Wisconsin, but didn't work when I was
on my boat in Florida and actually trying to navigate.  There were
no suggestions as to why gpsd doesn't seem to work in FC12, but a
fellow named Hamish posted a reply that was very useful regarding the
BSB-format charts available from NOAA's website.  Based on his info,
I was able to create a utility I call bsbtocv that automates the
process of converting and scaling the large files from NOAA into the
JPEG format I prefer, and it also creates automatically the calibration
information I need in my chart plotting program, chartview.

I never got gpsd earlier than version 2.92 to give me a position from
a print &quot;p\n&quot; query, e.g. -

        query:       &quot;p\n&quot;
        reply:       &quot;GPSD,P=36.000000 123.000000\r\n&quot;

but I finally got gpsd earlier than version 2.92 to give me position
information by asking it for NMEA raw mode with print &quot;r+\n&quot;, and the
problem seems to be fixed in 2.92, where the raw NMEA data contains
fixes ($GPGGA). Chartview now handles either version of gpsd.
It wasn't a trivial change.  I had to fork a process to handle the
NMEA data stream read from gpsd, The child process establishes the
connection with gpsd, asks for the raw NMEA data stream, which it reads
continuously, sending the most recent position encountered back to the
parent only when the parent requests it by signalling SIGUSR1 to the
child.  I know this seems overkill, and $socket-&gt;autoflush(1) should
make the connection to gpsd unbuffered, but during testing I discovered
I could get position information from gpsd for several minutes after
I'd killed the gpsd daemon, or unplugged the gps antenna; someone,
somewhere, is still doing buffering.  In order to get the most recent
position one must read continuously from the socket connected to gpsd.
I couldn't do this in the parent, since it's busy interacting with
the user at the display and responding to his requests.

At any rate, forking the child process to handle it is working, and I've
been able to test it by navigating on a cruise in my boat.  All of
the code, including bsbtocv, chartview itself, and a utility called
gpspos which illustrates using fork and the child/parent processes to
talk to gpsd and print the latest position on stdout, are available
in the tarball named chartview.tgz at -

I'm convinced THERE IS SOME INCOMPATIBILITY BETWEEN FEDORA CORE 12
AND GPSD EARLIER THAN 2.92.  When I upgraded to Fedora Core 12, I
ran xgps repeatedly, once for 24 hours and it couldn't get a &quot;FIX&quot;
even though it showed at least six satellites in the green, which I
presume means there's a solid signal.  I had another machine still
running Fedora Core 9 sitting right next to the one on FC12, and I
could unplug the usb/gps antenna from the fc12 machine, plug it into
the fc9 machine, and gpsd would show a position. The fc9 system had
gpsd-2.37-2.fc9.i386, and the fc12 had gpsd-2.39-5.fc12.i686, so I
tried downgrading the fc12 system to gpsd-2.27; same result.

I also tried upgrading to gpsd-2.92, and the daemon works, and the
NMEA data stream contains fix data ($GPGGA), but none of the ancillary
utilities except gpsmon work. xgps, for example, dies with the message
&quot;wrong ELF class: ELFCLASS64.&quot; But I can get gpsd to feed me raw data
with e.g. -

        telnet localhost 2947
        ?WATCH={&quot;class&quot;:&quot;WATCH&quot;,&quot;raw&quot;:1,&quot;nmea&quot;:true}


It prints the NMEA data in ASCII, intermixed with stuff in hexadecimal
But I can ignore the hex stuff and just grab the NMEA.
