<PRE>Now that the protocol redesign is done, development should be in a bit
of a lull for a few weeks.  That makes it a good time to tackle a
different kind of problem: moving to a better environment for
collaboration.

Berlios has, as we all know, significant reliability and uptime
issues. And, because our software often gets tested outdoors in
places without Internet connectivity in easy reach, Subversion chafes
a bit.  We'd be better served by one of the newer distributed
version-control systems where access to the central repo is not
required to commit to an experimental branch.

We don't have a new hosting site chosen yet (though Savannah is
looking like a plausible one).  But, for various technical reasons,
I have narrowed our choice of version-control systems down to 
hg (aka Mercurial) and git.

Accordingly, I will be experimenting with moving our repository state
over to git on Berlios.  Berlios doesn't offer hg, bnd the
capabilities of hg are close emnough to git to make lossless
migration possible; getting from Subversion to either one solves
the problem for both.

Commits are still open on the Subversion repo.  However, if the
migration looks successful, I may close access to the Subversion repo
and announce that we're a git project now

Being able to change sites in a separate step should help control
our risks and mitigate the pain of transition.

Don't think of it as `gun control', think of it as `victim
disarmament'. If we make enough laws, we can all be criminals.
