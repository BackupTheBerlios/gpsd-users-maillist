OK, well I have personally experienced time jitter as well as position 
jitter caused by signal bounce.  This was on a boat that I did some work 
on about 2-3 years ago, and the owner had mistakenly placed the GPS 
antenna at the top of the radar blipper, which was about half way up the 
mast.  Moving the GPS antenna down to the gunwale removed the signal 
bounce and eliminated the positional jitter.

Admittedly I did not measure nor test the time signal jitter caused by 
the signal bounce, except to note that the chartplotter into which the 
GPS data was fed periodically reported &quot;unable to determine GPS time&quot; 
while the antenna was incorrectly located, which problem went away when 
the antenna was relocated.

This was into a system that is fairly proprietary (navman chartplotter, 
not a PC, not running *ix) but using a 2 wire NMEA signal rather than 
going through a USB port.

&gt;<i> The USB transport is not suited for anything time-related that
</I>&gt;<i> requires sub-millisecond accuracy.
</I>
Agreed, but then again neither is NMEA.
