<PRE>Chris Kottaridis &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-users">chriskot at quietwind.net</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> I am OK now that I know the parameters so you don't need to pursue this
</I>&gt;<i> for my sake. But, if you want me to try some things to help sort things
</I>&gt;<i> out I am happy to try them.
</I>
I am not sure what the right thing to do is, or I'd try an experiment
and have you test it.  I would like gpsd to work more smoothly with
Bluetooth devices but, as you point out, there is a mismatch between
gpsd's device-management assumptions and how rfcomm works.
 
&gt;<i> I think the issue revolves around this feature of rfcomm bind:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;The connection will be established
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;right after an application tries to open the RFCOMM  device.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Since it waits for an open, simply turning on the device is not enough
</I>&gt;<i> to create a hotplug event. But without the hotplug event gpsd doesn't
</I>&gt;<i> know to try the open.
</I>
Correct.
 
&gt;<i> I assume that -n is for initial connection, but once it gets the NULL
</I>&gt;<i> read it thinks the device is off so gpsd closes the device and doesn't
</I>&gt;<i> periodically try and open it later. Say, every 30 secs or so. I assume
</I>&gt;<i> gpsd just waits for a hotplug event to try another open, which doesn't
</I>&gt;<i> happen simply by turning the device on.
</I>
That's right.  The elements for a solution may be present, however.
In serial.c:gpsd_classify(), we could identify Bluetooth devices as
a distinct type (at least under Linux) by checking for device major
216 or 217. Armed with that information, it is possible gpsd could
be taught to do periodic retry.

Note this comment in gpsd.c:

 * RELEASE_TIMEOUT sets the amount of time we hold a device
 * open after the last subscriber closes it; this is nonzero so a
 * client that does open/query/close will have time to come back and
 * do another single-shot query, if it wants to, before the device is
 * actually closed.  The reason this matters is because some Bluetooth
 * GPSes not only shut down the GPS receiver on close to save battery
 * power, they actually shut down the Bluetooth RF stage as well and
 * only re-wake it periodically to see if an attempt to raise the
 * device is in progress.  The result is that if you close the device
 * when it's powered up, a re-open can fail with EIO and needs to be
 * tried repeatedly.  Better to avoid this...
 *
 * DEVICE_REAWAKE says how long to wait before repolling after a zero-length
 * read. It's there so we avoid spinning forever on an EOF condition.

You should read the code around the uses of these constants.  It is
possible that a relatively minor logic change would solve the general
problem.  Lacking a Bluetooth device to test with I'm not inclined to
randonly tweak that code, but you might get somewhere.
