Hi again.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I then had to add the EAGAIN cases during the NTRIP probing and
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> opening, because the server could not possibly answer as fast as was
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> expected and the read failed every time on the nonblocking socket
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> with EAGAIN. The downside of this is that a non answering server
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> will cause an infinite loop here. Maybe a counter should be added
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> there.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This on the other hand is not good.  Besides the failure case you have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> pointed out, another problem is that while the usleep(3) is executing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> gpsd will block input from other data sources.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Both problems should be solved in the same way: ntrip_open() should
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> set a state in the device context that indicates an attempted open is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in progress, and then the actual open should be retried on each trip
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> around the main select(2) loop until we either hit a maximum-retry
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> threshold or the connection is established.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, you are right. The whole handshakish stuff should be decoupled. And
</I>&gt;<i> I think usleep isn't even portable. But the current code just does not
</I>&gt;<i> work, if the server doesn't answer in the microsecond it takes to get
</I>&gt;<i> from the write to the read. Which should be always for a non local
</I>&gt;<i> server. Another way would be to make the socket blocking. But there seem
</I>&gt;<i> to be some things, that break other code. (I tried it :-) )
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I will hopefully get another GPS receiver with RTCM capabilities soon so
</I>&gt;<i> I can do some experimenting with this. I have to delay this for now. Sorry.
</I>
I had a chance to take a look at the ntrip code for the connection
establishment.

It requires a huge amount of change in the ntrip code to make this work
and even some things in gpsd.c/gpsd.h-tail. This &quot;multi-stage&quot;
connection, as I started to call it, is quite hard to integrate into gpsd.

gpsd expects that a connection is open after calling open_device(). This
wouldn't be the case for ntrip and its mutli-stage connection process.

Meanwhile I am almost convinced, that a short wait in ntrip_open()
wouldn't hurt anyone. The explicit wait could be avoided by setting the
socket back to blocking during the connection establishment.

If this is not acceptable at all, I will try to get something working to
you with a mutli-stage connection for ntrip. It would need another
member in gps_context_t to keep the current state of the connection and
another path in consume_packet() (or main() ) to check if the connection
is actually an ntrip connection and not completely configured.

There may be more than only the state of the connection to remember. An
ntrip server is basically a http server and so does not send all of its
data in a single swoop. The ntrip_open might have to be called 5 or more
times until a connection is established, depending on the amount of data
the server sends and the size of the chunks it sends. I might want to
break the &quot;no static variables&quot; rule on that, if it is ok.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> The last one fixes the sending of the current position to the RTCM
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> caster. The current implementation sends exactly one GGA sentence to
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the server and then stops.  In my case that led to a closed
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> connection by the server because of an NMEA timeout.  Since this is
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the only Server I could try this with, I don't know the implications
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> of the change, but it works for me.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I don't understand this change yet, so I have not committed it.  Let's
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> get the probe/open problem solved first.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Problem is, that the server (or maybe this particular one) drops the
</I>&gt;<i> connection as soon as GPS updates fail to arrive in a certain timeout.
</I>&gt;<i> The former code just sent exactly one update (a GGA sentence through
</I>&gt;<i> gpsd_position_fix_dump()) and then nothing more, so the connection was
</I>&gt;<i> dropped after about 20 seconds every time.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This flag is set once and never reset: session-&gt;context-&gt;sentdgps = true
</I>&gt;<i> But when it is set, no updates are sent to the server. The patch sends
</I>&gt;<i> periodic updates to the server.
</I>
This is still valid. If an ntrip server needs NMEA updates, this has to
be done.

  Andre
