Sorry, I was not using precise terminology.

For lack of a better term in your discussion, I'm going to show off my
knowledge of things medieval and byzantine and swipe the term
&quot;indiction&quot; to refer to the 19.6 year interval.
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiction.">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiction.</A> So what I meant was that I get
the correct indiction on first firing up the daemon and receiver, but
not thereafter. The week number is correct, it's just that we are
assuming the wrong indiction.

&gt;<i> It
</I>&gt;<i> does use the daemon start time to deduce what rollover period, year,
</I>&gt;<i> and century it started in, but this information is used only to
</I>&gt;<i> compensate for rollovers and year or century transitions that happen
</I>&gt;<i> *while the daemon is running*.
</I>
It doesn't seem to be doing that, since the daemon is running
continuously even during the time the receiver is unplugged. I
conjecture that the daemon doesn't maintain an internal clock. Even if
the system clock were wrong, you could still use it to time intervals
closely enough to get back in synch once the receiver did re-appear.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I did consider trying to write code to deduce when a time reported
</I>&gt;<i> after cold or warm boot is incorrect. In fact I gave this problem
</I>&gt;<i> concentrated attention for about two weeks.  I concluded that trying 
</I>&gt;<i> to &quot;fix&quot; it was a bad idea, as all the disambiguation methods I
</I>&gt;<i> could come up with were both inadequate for most cases or seemed
</I>&gt;<i> prone to weird bugs in edge cases or both (usually both, in fact).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Some of my travails are described here: <A HREF="http://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=2882">http://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=2882</A>
</I>
I read that, its predecessor, and many of the comments. I'm not sure you
are stating the problem *as it applies to gpsd* correctly. I think even
if the system clock is wrong, you may still find it useful. You could
assume it is correct to within the indiction, i.e. +/- a semi-indiction.
So you are either in indiction N or indiction N+1. The week number tells
you which one.

You can still use the gps time to set the system clock, just make sure
you know which indiction you are in before you do.

If your system clock is off by more than that, human observation will
tell you so, and you have other problems.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I would be glad to write a braindead client in Perl to check for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; this (and verify the 19.6 year conjecture), but I expect you would
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; prefer that in Python.  
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Nah.  I believe your report. Got some similar tire tracks in my back.
</I>
I was thinking of adding it to the live testing tools.

&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Any suggestions on how to proceed, other than buy a new receiver
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; capable of dealing with a 13 bit week number?  
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Don't trust your GPS date.  Time is generally accurate, because GPS
</I>&gt;<i> TOW isn't subject to rollover effects.
</I>
I take it TOW is Time of the Week, i.e. seconds since week rollover.

Position, as far as I can tell, is also accurate. If I understand
correctly how the GPS works, that is as it should be. I'd want reports
from other observers far from me before I were confident of that,
though.

If I trusted my GPS date, I wouldn't have reported the observations or
the problem. I'd be complimenting myself on being well preserved for my
age, except for the one time when I got a GPS year in the early 1900s.
And I'd be confusing the hell out of my friends, creditors and bank.
