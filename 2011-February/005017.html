<PRE>Been using -n. In /etc/sysconfig/gpsd I have:

OPTIONS=&quot;-n&quot;
#DEVICE=&quot;/dev/ttyUSB0&quot;
DEVICE=&quot;/dev/rfcomm0&quot;

and -n does seem to be enabled:

$ ps -axlww | grep gpsd
5    99  2076     1  10 -10  29588  1376 poll_s S&lt;s  ?
0:23 /usr/sbin/gpsd -P /var/run/gpsd.pid -F /var/run/gpsd.sock
-n /dev/rfcomm0

I am OK now that I know the parameters so you don't need to pursue this
for my sake. But, if you want me to try some things to help sort things
out I am happy to try them.

I think the issue revolves around this feature of rfcomm bind:

&gt;<i>The connection will be established
</I>&gt;<i>right after an application tries to open the RFCOMM  device.
</I>
Since it waits for an open, simply turning on the device is not enough
to create a hotplug event. But without the hotplug event gpsd doesn't
know to try the open.

I assume that -n is for initial connection, but once it gets the NULL
read it thinks the device is off so gpsd closes the device and doesn't
periodically try and open it later. Say, every 30 secs or so. I assume
gpsd just waits for a hotplug event to try another open, which doesn't
happen simply by turning the device on.

I played a little with the rfcomm's listen and watch options to see if I
could get rfcomm to generate a hotplug event with no success. But, I
really haven't had the time to sit down with them, so I may not be using
them correctly. Maybe using one of these options will make turning a
device on enough to generate a hotplug event which can let gpsd know
that the device is again available.

Thanks

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Yeah, I think this is the crux of the issue. When you bind the rfcomm
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; device you don't get a hotplug event until after the device is turned on
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and someone does an open of /dev/rfcomm0.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So, you get connected, turn off the device and get a NULL read so gpsd
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; closes the device. You turn the device on, but rfcomm won't generate an
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ADD event until some application does an open now that the device is on.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; But, gpsd has the device closed until the ADD event happens and someone
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; touches the device list to generate an open request. So there seems to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; be a chicken and egg thing going on.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I think USB type devices generate an ADD just by getting plugged in, but
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the rfcomm device does not seem to do that until an open is done.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Possible workaround: run gpsd in -n mode.  Try that and see if it solves 
</I>&gt;<i> your problem.
