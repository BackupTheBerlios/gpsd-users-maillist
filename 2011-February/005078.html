   Wouldn't that introduce a new hardware dependency though? I do not
think the current gpsd requires the presence of a (time-of-day) clock in
the host computer.

&gt;<i> Hm.  That is possible, maybe. Trying to think through all the

   Isn't most of the problem when one tries to project the error
correction into the future (i.e., after the release date of that gpsd
instance)?  Detecting a rollover bug that results in a date 20 years in
the past being reported is at present not hard (conceptually), and
should be useful for a good few years after release date. Still, it is
not entirely deterministic, so probably not worth the effort. Which I
guess brings me full circle back to your conclusion. :-/

&gt;<i> There's a problem.  We don't necessarily know the indiction length.

</I>
   Isn't that the receiver's problem? Either it can receive and
understand the CNAV message or it can't.  In the first case you
shouldn't see a 1024 week rollover (assuming the firmware is half-sane)
even in the presence of a mixture of CNAV capable and non CNAV capable SVs.

   Generalising this line of thought, in the case of a
multi-constellation capable receiver, one expects the receiver to be
capable of doing the right thing even in the presence of a mix of
NAVSTAR (Mk1) signals (1024 week rollover), GLONASS (Mk1) (four year
rollover), NAVSTAR CNAV (8192 week rollover ~157 years), GLONASS-M (124
year rollover), GLONASS-K (no idea), Galileo (4096 weeks ~78 years),
Beidou-2 (not a clue), and whatever else might be out there these days.

   Should gpsd be concerned with any of the above in any particular way?
