Hmm. I don't know why that is (I could reproduce it though).

This time I tried it against commit 0d077114f17012a3c609dab88dcfdcc71b9cbb44
from Gary E. Miller and it applies. Sorry for the hassle.

gpsd_ntrip.patch contains the whole patch including the gpsd_open.patch, which I
attached for review on its own. If it breaks something, just leave it out. It
should not interfere with the rest of the changes.

I think it is better to not paste the whole patch into the mail-body. With the
size you can probably view it better with some other viewer. At least I think so.

&gt;<i> I may try applying some of these by hand if I decide I understand them.
</I>&gt;<i> But we really ought to figure out why the patch was bad.
</I>
I will gladly walk you through each segment. :-)
I am aware of the hugeness of the patch and the amount of code to review.

Greg Troxel mentioned I should set up a git repository to do such things. I will
do that the next time I try something like this. For this time I first tried to make
gpsd work for me and then switched to using the git features. So I only have the changes
in this inconvenient way.

&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> What it does is the following.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - workaround for some kind of bug in the python client.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   This is probably wrong, but I don't know what to fix there with my 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   limited python abilities. X-)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Would you describe the bug to me, please?  Preferably including a 
</I>&gt;<i> backtrace.  That last line - the change to the dictwrapper call -
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't look quite right to me.
</I>
certainly. As soon as a json rtcm2 message arrives, this traceback is
generated from xgps:

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File &quot;./xgps&quot;, line 696, in handle_response
    if self.daemon.read() == -1:
  File &quot;/home/nautsch/test/gpsd/gpsd-git-taint/gps/gps.py&quot;, line 303, in read
    self.json_unpack(self.response)
  File &quot;/home/nautsch/test/gpsd/gpsd-git-taint/gps/client.py&quot;, line 151, in json_unpack
    self.data = dictwrapper(**asciify(json.loads(buf.strip(), )))
  File &quot;/home/nautsch/test/gpsd/gpsd-git-taint/gps/client.py&quot;, line 145, in asciify
    va = map(asciify, v)
  File &quot;/home/nautsch/test/gpsd/gpsd-git-taint/gps/client.py&quot;, line 138, in asciify
    for (k, v) in d.items():
AttributeError: 'unicode' object has no attribute 'items'

After this xgps stands still. My patch was a workaround for something I am
definitely missing in the depth of the python code :-). And I heard from a
colleague, that the issue was not completely gone.

I left this out of the big patch, because my workaround was probably the wrong thing
to do to fix this.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - simplify the way add_device and open_device are used
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Hm.  I want to know more about this before I apply it.  There
</I>&gt;<i> may be subtleties you are missing, and I'm reluctabt to destabilize 
</I>&gt;<i> core code when we're gearing up for a release.  
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Can you separate this patch fromn the NTRIP fixes? I consider
</I>&gt;<i> those much less risky.
</I>
Yes. See attachment gpsd_open.patch. But I only compile tested this without the other changes.

It basically removes the necessity to go through the whole device list again
by giving a device as a parameter to gpsd_open instead of the path.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - the context-&gt;dsock is now unset when an ntrip server disconnects
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - the ntrip connection is reestablished, when it worked but got 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   disconnected by the server. This is done only, when the connection
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   was good the last time.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - the ntrip connection is now multistaged. the gps_open just 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   initializes the connection process. The remaining connection is done
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   from consume_packet
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - The patch from the earlier mails, which does an NMEA update to an 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   ntrip server in a semi regular interval.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> These certainly sound like theyt're heading in a good direction.
</I>
That sounds good to me.

Regards
  Andre
