<PRE>Andre Naujoks &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-users">nautsch2 at googlemail.com</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> Hmm. I had a look at the manpages for gpsfake, but it nowhere says, that
</I>&gt;<i> (or how) I can just include rtcm data into a logfile.
</I>
&gt;<i>From packet.c:
</I>
 * 4) ISGPS packets. The input may be a bitstream containing IS-GPS-200
 *    packets.  Each includes a fixed leader byte, a length, and check bits.
 *    In this case, it is not guaranted that packet starts begin on byte
 *    bounaries; the recognizer has to run a separate state machine against
 *    each byte just to achieve synchronization lock with the bitstream.
 *

This logic is used to automatically sync up with and and interpret raw RTCM2
feeds presented on a serial device, such as one might get from an RTCM2
radio.  So a logfile containing raw RTCM2 packets will work - in fact, we 
routinely regression-test exactly this case using the files test/sample.rtcm2
and sample.rtcm2.chk.

I don't know the format that NTRIP uses to pass back RTCM2 packets. If you
explained that, we could probably come up with something.

&gt;<i> Would a gpspipe output help? I attached a very short one, which should
</I>&gt;<i> trigger the error immediately.
</I>
This will do for client testing.  I have a utility called gpsdfake that
I can feed this to that will cycle through these lines, presenting them
on port 2947.  

It's not a completely satisfactory long-term solution, though, as it doesn't
regression-test the NTRIP support in the daemon.  If you want that to be
really stable, we need to figure out some way that gpsfake can fool the
gpsd process it encloses into thinking it has opened an NTRIP session, and
feed NTRIP data to the daemon in the same way the daemon would see it
in a live session.

(Yes, gpsfake is different from gpsdfake.  gpsdfake pretends to be an
instance of gpsd to fool client programs. gpsfake creates fake serial devices
using ptys and pretends to be a collection of GPS defices; it fools gpsd. The
point in both cases is to enable testing under controlled conditions.)
