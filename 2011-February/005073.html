<PRE>Charles Curley &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-users">charlescurley at charlescurley.com</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> For lack of a better term in your discussion, I'm going to show off my
</I>&gt;<i> knowledge of things medieval and byzantine and swipe the term
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;indiction&quot; to refer to the 19.6 year interval.
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiction.">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiction.</A>
</I>
I like it. I've been calling this a &quot;rollover period&quot;.

&gt;<i> &gt; It
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; does use the daemon start time to deduce what rollover period, year,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and century it started in, but this information is used only to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; compensate for rollovers and year or century transitions that happen
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; *while the daemon is running*.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It doesn't seem to be doing that, since the daemon is running
</I>&gt;<i> continuously even during the time the receiver is unplugged.
</I>
Right. I should have said that the only transitions gpsd can
compensate for reliably is when they happen while the daemon i
and the device are running continuously.

&gt;<i> I conjecture that the daemon doesn't maintain an internal clock.
</I>
Correct.

&gt;<i>                                                             Even if
</I>&gt;<i> the system clock were wrong, you could still use it to time intervals
</I>&gt;<i> closely enough to get back in synch once the receiver did re-appear.
</I>
Hm.  That is possible, maybe. Trying to think through all the
potential edge cases makes my brain hurt, though.  I fear making
hard-to-detect errors, which is why I gave up on attempts to be clever
about this.

&gt;<i> I read that, its predecessor, and many of the comments. I'm not sure you
</I>&gt;<i> are stating the problem *as it applies to gpsd* correctly. I think even
</I>&gt;<i> if the system clock is wrong, you may still find it useful. You could
</I>&gt;<i> assume it is correct to within the indiction, i.e. +/- a semi-indiction.
</I>&gt;<i> So you are either in indiction N or indiction N+1. The week number tells
</I>&gt;<i> you which one.
</I>
There's a problem.  We don't necessarily know the indiction length.
Now it's 2^10 weeks, in the future it could be 2^13, and we don't yet
have a way to tell which bird might be shipping 13 bits.

&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I would be glad to write a braindead client in Perl to check for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; this (and verify the 19.6 year conjecture), but I expect you would
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; prefer that in Python.  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Nah.  I believe your report. Got some similar tire tracks in my back.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I was thinking of adding it to the live testing tools.
</I>
I will cheerfully accept it, then.

&gt;<i> I take it TOW is Time of the Week, i.e. seconds since week rollover.
</I>
Correct.

If you want to suggest improved date-disambiguation algorithms, I
suggest you start by reading timebase.c.  I sealed away all the
hair relating to conversion from GPS week+TOW to UTC in there.
