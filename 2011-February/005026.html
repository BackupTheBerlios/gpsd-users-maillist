</I>&gt;<i> Also I've added RTCM passthrough to the ubx driver as you suggested.
</I>
Thank you! :-)

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The first change in net_ntrip.c adds another string to the valid strings for

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for the sourcetable of the server. The mountpoint I am using is EPS_NI.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The problem is the RTCM1_ data format. The people from sapos confirmed,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that this is a RTCM2 stream and so far it works.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That change is also fine and I have committed it.
</I>
Great! Thanks.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I then had to add the EAGAIN cases during the NTRIP probing and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> opening, because the server could not possibly answer as fast as was
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> expected and the read failed every time on the nonblocking socket
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with EAGAIN. The downside of this is that a non answering server
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> will cause an infinite loop here. Maybe a counter should be added
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> there.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This on the other hand is not good.  Besides the failure case you have
</I>&gt;<i> pointed out, another problem is that while the usleep(3) is executing
</I>&gt;<i> gpsd will block input from other data sources.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Both problems should be solved in the same way: ntrip_open() should
</I>&gt;<i> set a state in the device context that indicates an attempted open is
</I>&gt;<i> in progress, and then the actual open should be retried on each trip
</I>&gt;<i> around the main select(2) loop until we either hit a maximum-retry
</I>&gt;<i> threshold or the connection is established.
</I>
Yes, you are right. The whole handshakish stuff should be decoupled. And
I think usleep isn't even portable. But the current code just does not
work, if the server doesn't answer in the microsecond it takes to get
from the write to the read. Which should be always for a non local
server. Another way would be to make the socket blocking. But there seem
to be some things, that break other code. (I tried it :-) )

I will hopefully get another GPS receiver with RTCM capabilities soon so
I can do some experimenting with this. I have to delay this for now. Sorry.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The last one fixes the sending of the current position to the RTCM
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> caster. The current implementation sends exactly one GGA sentence to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the server and then stops.  In my case that led to a closed
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> connection by the server because of an NMEA timeout.  Since this is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the only Server I could try this with, I don't know the implications
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of the change, but it works for me.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I don't understand this change yet, so I have not committed it.  Let's
</I>&gt;<i> get the probe/open problem solved first.
</I>
Problem is, that the server (or maybe this particular one) drops the
connection as soon as GPS updates fail to arrive in a certain timeout.
The former code just sent exactly one update (a GGA sentence through
gpsd_position_fix_dump()) and then nothing more, so the connection was
dropped after about 20 seconds every time.

This flag is set once and never reset: session-&gt;context-&gt;sentdgps = true
But when it is set, no updates are sent to the server. The patch sends
periodic updates to the server.

This brought up another one, which is, that the updates stop as soon as
the GPS fix is gone. I don't know what to do about that because this is
something you can't influence from the code. Maybe something like an
automatic reconnect to the NTRIP server is needed here.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It's good to have someone actively interested in making NTRIP work.
</I>&gt;<i> That code had gotten rather dusty.
</I>
Hehe. I *was* wondering about that :-)

  Andre
