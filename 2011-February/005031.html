<PRE>Andre Naujoks &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-users">nautsch2 at googlemail.com</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> As promised here is a huge patch which *should* apply to the current git head.
</I>
Alas, it did not.  Almost all bands other than the change to gps/client.py
failed with patch -p1.  The exceptions were one band for gpsd.h-tail and
one for net_ntrip.c.

I may try applying some of these by hand if I decide I understand them.
But we really ought to figure out why the patch was bad.
 
&gt;<i> What it does is the following.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - workaround for some kind of bug in the python client.
</I>&gt;<i>   This is probably wrong, but I don't know what to fix there with my 
</I>&gt;<i>   limited python abilities. X-)
</I>
Would you describe the bug to me, please?  Preferably including a 
backtrace.  That last line - the change to the dictwrapper call -
doesn't look quite right to me.

&gt;<i> - simplify the way add_device and open_device are used
</I>
Hm.  I want to know more about this before I apply it.  There
may be subtleties you are missing, and I'm reluctabt to destabilize 
core code when we're gearing up for a release.  

Can you separate this patch fromn the NTRIP fixes? I consider
those much less risky.

&gt;<i> - the context-&gt;dsock is now unset when an ntrip server disconnects
</I>&gt;<i> - the ntrip connection is reestablished, when it worked but got 
</I>&gt;<i>   disconnected by the server. This is done only, when the connection
</I>&gt;<i>   was good the last time.
</I>&gt;<i> - the ntrip connection is now multistaged. the gps_open just 
</I>&gt;<i>   initializes the connection process. The remaining connection is done
</I>&gt;<i>   from consume_packet
</I>&gt;<i> - The patch from the earlier mails, which does an NMEA update to an 
</I>&gt;<i>   ntrip server in a semi regular interval.
</I>
These certainly sound like theyt're heading in a good direction.
