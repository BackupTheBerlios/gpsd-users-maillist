<PRE>Andre Naujoks &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-users">nautsch2 at googlemail.com</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> The first thing I had to do to make RTCM work at all, was to remove
</I>&gt;<i> the separate poll for the socket (the change in gpsd.c). The same
</I>&gt;<i> stuff is done in consume_packet, so there is no loss here. In fact
</I>&gt;<i> the duplicated read caused constant lock losses on the RTCM stream
</I>&gt;<i> because of missing data, which was already read by the now removed
</I>&gt;<i> read.
</I>
Excellent code simplification, thank you, I have committed this.  I aso
removed a no-longer-used function that the removed code called, and I took
your fix in your followup email to set the RTCM2 timestamp on receipt.
Also I've added RTCM passthrough to the ubx driver as you suggested.

&gt;<i> The first change in net_ntrip.c adds another string to the valid strings for
</I>&gt;<i> rtcm2 to be recognized. See: <A HREF="http://www.sapos-ni-ntrip.de:2101/sourcetable.htm">http://www.sapos-ni-ntrip.de:2101/sourcetable.htm</A>
</I>&gt;<i> for the sourcetable of the server. The mountpoint I am using is EPS_NI.
</I>&gt;<i> The problem is the RTCM1_ data format. The people from sapos confirmed,
</I>&gt;<i> that this is a RTCM2 stream and so far it works.
</I>
That change is also fine and I have committed it.

&gt;<i> I then had to add the EAGAIN cases during the NTRIP probing and
</I>&gt;<i> opening, because the server could not possibly answer as fast as was
</I>&gt;<i> expected and the read failed every time on the nonblocking socket
</I>&gt;<i> with EAGAIN. The downside of this is that a non answering server
</I>&gt;<i> will cause an infinite loop here. Maybe a counter should be added
</I>&gt;<i> there.
</I>
This on the other hand is not good.  Besides the failure case you have
pointed out, another problem is that while the usleep(3) is executing
gpsd will block input from other data sources.

Both problems should be solved in the same way: ntrip_open() should
set a state in the device context that indicates an attempted open is
in progress, and then the actual open should be retried on each trip
around the main select(2) loop until we either hit a maximum-retry
threshold or the connection is established.

&gt;<i> The last one fixes the sending of the current position to the RTCM
</I>&gt;<i> caster. The current implementation sends exactly one GGA sentence to
</I>&gt;<i> the server and then stops.  In my case that led to a closed
</I>&gt;<i> connection by the server because of an NMEA timeout.  Since this is
</I>&gt;<i> the only Server I could try this with, I don't know the implications
</I>&gt;<i> of the change, but it works for me.
</I>
I don't understand this change yet, so I have not committed it.  Let's
get the probe/open problem solved first.

It's good to have someone actively interested in making NTRIP work.
That code had gotten rather dusty.
