&gt;<i> Hi all,

Manufacturer? Model number? Chipset? gpsd will identify the latter for
you.

Prolific PL2303 is an RS-232 to USB adapter chip. These are fairly
common in USB GPS receivers, and a well known commodity for gpsd's
developers. But they aren't the GPS receiver, which is the chipset
you're really interested in.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm having problems getting them to work reliably. Sometime I would
</I>&gt;<i> plug them in - and the blue led starts flashing almost straight away.
</I>
Usually the result of a warm start, i.e. you've used it recently enough
that the data on the receiver is still valid.

&gt;<i> Other times I could be driving 25 minutes with the laptop in my car,
</I>&gt;<i> the dongle plugged in, and the blue led stays on solid and doesn't
</I>&gt;<i> want to start flashing (which indicates a fix).
</I>
Often a long start-up time means the on-board data is obsolete and the
chipset had to acquire new data. This can take up to half an hour.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I thought it might be some udev script or other software on my laptop 
</I>&gt;<i> that is sending data which is locking the chip up - so I tried to
</I>&gt;<i> plug them in when the laptop is in stand-by - just power on the usb
</I>&gt;<i> ports. It doesn't seem to make a difference.
</I>
It shouldn't. If my diagnosis is correct, the time to a good fix
depends on how good the on-board data is, and is independent of what
your laptop's software does. Not knowing the model or chipset, this is
a guess.
