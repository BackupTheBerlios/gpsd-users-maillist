It would be nice though to have a /etc/gpsd.conf file like:

#/etc/gpsd.conf
[global]
port=3000


[receiver_1]
serial=4090039409
no_wait=yes
bt_safe=no

[receiver_2]
serial=4099309409098
no_wait=yes
bt_safe=yes

Of course, gpsd would continue to run its sanity checks everytime it 
tries to open a device. Also, it's code can be used to probe a new 
device, when it is added to the config file (through a console or X 
based wizard, for example).

The above system is akin to pairing to Bluetooth devices. Surely the 
same concept can be applied to &quot;pairing&quot; to a gps device?

Then, a gpsdconf script could be built, which is run by the user 
everytime they want to add a new dongle to the config file - which would 
run a simpe wizard, extract the serial from the hardware, and add it 
together with options to the gpsd.conf file.

I think identifying adapters by serial id's is the only way, as these 
usb-to-serial converters are used in so many other pieces of hardware - 
it's really unreliable to identify by manufacturer id in the default 
config files.

This would require for the user to manually add a new device initially 
to the configuration file (directly or through a wizard) - but it means 
that gpsd could just poll the filesystem (through inotify for example) 
for new /dev/ttyUSBx or /dev/ttySx devices, and connect to them 
dynamically if their serial number is in the config file. None of the 
current setup, where udev rules triggers gpsd.hotplug.wrapper script 
which triggers gpsd.hotplug script, which talks to gpsd through gpsctl 
through a socket - which means that gpsd can't be started with usb_auto 
while the root filesystem is mounted read-only. Surely, whichever way 
you look at it, the current setup is not pretty, or elegant, or 
potentially reliable with so many different pieces of software involved.

And I'm not sure I understand why a simple config file, like the one 
above, would be a downside for embedded systems?

Merely enquiring after an entire weekend spent trying to fit a square 
gpsd into a round Slackware init script whole, where udev runs initially 
on a read-only filesystem (and doesn't allow gpsd to create its socket 
file).
