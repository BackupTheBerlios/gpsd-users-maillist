OK - if you prefer some separation of tasks, why don't you at least 
simplify the interface between udev/hotplug system and gpsd. Why don't 
you modify the behaviour of the --add switch so that at least can cope 
with both situations:

a. If gpsd is not running, it will start it and add the device to it's 
pool of devices.
b. If it can find a gpsd process already running, add the device to it's 
pool.

At the moment it is impossible to just have a simple udev rule such as 
&quot;RUN+=&quot;gpsd /ttyUSB0&quot; because it can't cope if there is already a daemon 
running. Thus you end up with scripts which check if the gpsd is already 
running, and pass commands through gpsdctl, or if it is not running, 
start it. What you are basically doing is keeping gpsd pure from a 
programming point of view, with as little options as possible - while 
dumping the mess of controlling it and starting it to system packagers 
and end users by providing an inappropriate interface.

Well, so instead of having &quot;evil&quot; config files, you prefer to have a 
chain of 4 other pieces of software doing what one single, well designed 
one could have done. Seems to me like taking a pretty narrow view of 
hight quality programming.

&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Bad, *bad* idea.  It would involve our C code with the details of the

</I>
Fine - in that case find a way so that the hotplug system can pass a 
single, simple command line to gpsd when a new device is plugged in - 
instead of requiring two different scripts which don't even work 
properly on all distributions.
