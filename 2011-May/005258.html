Just a follow-up to my previous emails. First, in answer to some 
comments made by posters. I take onboard what people are saying about 
long ttff's and their causes, but:

1. I'm talking about warm starts - and by that, I mean that the dongle 
would have been used (and locked onto satellites) one or two hours 
prior, in the same location. I think in that case 20-40 minutes ttff is 
a long time, in an open place, with no obstructions above, or tall 
buildings in vicinity.

2. Re: Gary's comment about older gps's taking a long time to start. 
This is a brand new gps dongle, usb based, with Sirf III chipset and 
internal ceramic antenna (whatever that means). I hope, in that case, 
that the 30 minutes+ startup time shouldn't apply to this one.

3. I don't think that the quality of the reception on the passenger seat 
is a problem for this particular gps dongle. I always use it there, and 
once it gets a lock, it works absolutely brilliantly. I've done hundreds 
of miles with laptop+dongle on passenger seat, including in town/cities 
among buildings - and once it obtains a lock, it will keep on working 
rock solid until the end of the journey - no matter how long.

However, I've done some more tests. Last night it took 22 minutes to 
obtain a fix, after being used only 5 hours previously, (with the 
previous journey ending where the later one started - so same location). 
This was with the laptop on. Two hours later, on the way back, again 
starting where the previous journey ended, it refused to obtain a fix 
for the entire journey of over 40 minutes with the laptop on. All this 
travelling was done on motorway/highway on flat, open fields.

Today I've tried it on several occasions with the laptop in stand-by 
(only power from usb, no data). Every time I plug it in with the laptop 
in standby (in the car), it doesn't fail to obtain a fix within 1-2 
minutes. The blue light just starts flashing, even when I'm in between 
buildings.

This is now looking distinctly like a software problem. I assume that 
something is sending some commands to the usb port, which gets the gps 
chipset confused. My main suspects are kernel/kernel tty drivers, udev 
and gpsd. I will have to start narrowing things down.

Sebastian
