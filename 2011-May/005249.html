<PRE>Hi all,

I have two GPS USB dongles with the Prolific PL2303 chipset. They were 
bought about 1.5 years apart from Maplin in UK - and they appear to be 
two different models by same manufacturer - one is white and the other 
is black - but they look pretty much identical otherwise.

I'm having problems getting them to work reliably. Sometime I would plug 
them in - and the blue led starts flashing almost straight away. Other 
times I could be driving 25 minutes with the laptop in my car, the 
dongle plugged in, and the blue led stays on solid and doesn't want to 
start flashing (which indicates a fix).

I thought it might be some udev script or other software on my laptop 
that is sending data which is locking the chip up - so I tried to plug 
them in when the laptop is in stand-by - just power on the usb ports. It 
doesn't seem to make a difference. The strange thing is that, after they 
get going, they are great. I've taken the white dongle with me last year 
to France and used it all over the place with Navit as my GPS navigator.

I would like some ideas to further troubleshoot them. How do I find out 
if, when the blue light is solid, the chipset is trying to lock onto 
satellites and it is failing because of weak signal - or it is in some 
inconsistent state because of some other reason? Gpsd only reports that 
there are no useful fixes coming in from the sensor - but it won't tell 
me if the chipset is otherwise working ok and responding to commands.

What I would like to find out is if:

1. These dongles/chipsets are rubbish and I should just go and buy 
other/better GPS USB adapters.
2. Flashing them with a different firmware would improve things.
3. I can do anything else to get them to work more reliably, and lock 
onto satellites in a more predictable manner. If it takes 5 or 10 
minutes every time, I'm fine with that - as long as I know they will 
eventually get a fix, instead of hanging in limbo, sometimes indefinitely.

Any suggestions are most appreciated.

Sebastian
