Well, I'm all happy with that philosophy. Then why does it take four 
different configuration/script files and a Unix socket (which means you 
need RW access to the file system when you start gpsd) in order to hot 
plug gps devices? You need:
/etc/default/gpsd
/etc/udev/rules.d/gpsd.rules
/lib/udev/gpsd.hotplug
/lib/udev/gpsd.hotplug.wrapper

I was suggesting an approach which would have used one single 
/etc/gpsd.conf instead of the four above. If somebody can do away with 
all of them without replacement, that's even better.

It seems to me that  in order to avoid a single configuration file at 
all costs, the setup ended up far more complicated then it was needed.

The way I see it, the main problem is that gpsd doesn't have (as far as 
I can figure out) an operation mode where it keeps an eye out on new 
/dev/ttyUSBx and /dev/ttySx devices and connects to them automatically 
when they are inserted - without needing udev, udev rules, one Bash 
script, one Python script, one config file in /etc and one Unix socket.
