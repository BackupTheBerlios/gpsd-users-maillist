<PRE>Sebastian Arcus &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-users">shop at open-t.co.uk</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> OK - if you prefer some separation of tasks, why don't you at least
</I>&gt;<i> simplify the interface between udev/hotplug system and gpsd. Why
</I>&gt;<i> don't you modify the behaviour of the --add switch so that at least
</I>&gt;<i> can cope with both situations:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> a. If gpsd is not running, it will start it and add the device to
</I>&gt;<i> it's pool of devices.
</I>&gt;<i> b. If it can find a gpsd process already running, add the device to
</I>&gt;<i> it's pool.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> At the moment it is impossible to just have a simple udev rule such
</I>&gt;<i> as &quot;RUN+=&quot;gpsd /ttyUSB0&quot; because it can't cope if there is already a
</I>&gt;<i> daemon running. Thus you end up with scripts which check if the gpsd
</I>&gt;<i> is already running, and pass commands through gpsdctl, or if it is
</I>&gt;<i> not running, start it. 
</I>
It already works this way.  That is, &quot;gpsd.hotplug add /dev/foo&quot;
starts a damon instance required before shipping the add command.
If you are not seeing this behavior, you may have a bug at udev level.

&gt;<i>    What you are basically doing is keeping gpsd
</I>&gt;<i> pure from a programming point of view, with as little options as
</I>&gt;<i> possible - while dumping the mess of controlling it and starting it
</I>&gt;<i> to system packagers and end users by providing an inappropriate
</I>&gt;<i> interface.
</I>
That's all correct, except for the conjuct &quot;end users&quot; annd the
adjective &quot;inappropriate&quot;. End users never see this; that's the point
of zero configuration.

Controlling gpsd and starting gpsd *is* a mess; that's unavoidable due
to platform issues.  When you can code a mess like that in Python or
shell rather than C, it's an excellent idea to do so and *not* to have
that mess commingled with your core code.

&gt;<i> Well, so instead of having &quot;evil&quot; config files, you prefer to have a
</I>&gt;<i> chain of 4 other pieces of software doing what one single, well
</I>&gt;<i> designed one could have done. Seems to me like taking a pretty
</I>&gt;<i> narrow view of hight quality programming.
</I>
If you think a single, well-designed script can replace all four of
those files, I think you have no idea how udev actually works.  But
I would be happy if you proved me wrong by writing that script and
submitting it.

&gt;<i> Fine - in that case find a way so that the hotplug system can pass a
</I>&gt;<i> single, simple command line to gpsd when a new device is plugged in
</I>&gt;<i> - instead of requiring two different scripts which don't even work
</I>&gt;<i> properly on all distributions.
</I>
If you explain how they're failing, perhaps they can be fixed.
