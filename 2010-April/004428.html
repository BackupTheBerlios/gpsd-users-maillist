</I>&gt;<i> OK, that's what I was trying to pin down.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> And why couldn't it be in the order 4, 1, 2? What I would like to see is:

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 1. gpsd daemon is running, client application is started, connects

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 2. like your 2 above

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a different device), start sending him data from the device.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But....that *is* how it works. &#160;Or at least, how I designed it to work,
</I>&gt;<i> and how it seems to work when I test it. &#160;I am deeply confused now.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Or I'll try to tell it from the perspective of a user of say GPS
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> navigation application:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 1. User starts the application (which internally does the same as in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> step 1 above)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 2. He starts his GPS device - his position will start updating
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 3. An interference comes so the bluetooth connection gets lost - his
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> position isn't updated any more
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 4. The bluetooth connection gets reestablished after a while - the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> position starts updating again
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 5. The user turns off his bluetooth GPS device - his position isn't
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> updated any more
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 6. The user connects his USB GPS device - &#160;the position starts updating again
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;From your description, this isn't possible now - you have to reissue
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> WATCH after 2, 4 and 6 in order to get updates again (and looks like
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> some remains of the pull interface where you have to issue a command
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> first in order to get some data).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> No. &#160;You only have to issue WATCH once. &#160;The way to think about it is
</I>&gt;<i> that whenever one or more WATCHES is active, gpsd wants to have every
</I>&gt;<i> device in its pool open. &#160;Whenever the hotplug system tells it one has
</I>&gt;<i> gone live, it tries to open the device and stream reports from it to
</I>&gt;<i> everybody.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I talked about a race condition before because gpsd will throw a device
</I>&gt;<i> out of its pool if a read from it fails.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If all client sessions close, then gpsd revets to putting devices
</I>&gt;<i> it's notified about in its pool without trying to open them.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Is there some technical problem implementing this behaviour? From what
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> you say it seems that gpsd gets informed when the device gets
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> available so I don't see a reason why, when some clients are still
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> connected and watching, the clients couldn't start receiving data from
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the device (after first receiving the DEVICE message). This is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> actually what I expected would happen even from the documentation.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, that's how it's supposed to work. &#160;If it's not working that
</I>&gt;<i> way for you we need to fugure out why.
</I>
No, it doesn't work that way - good to hear it's a bug after all :-).
If I'm listening on the port and issue WATCH before the device is
started, I never get data from gpsd (until I re-issue WATCH when after
the device is started).

So I have been experimenting with it a bit and there is one
interesting thing. The GPS device has a LED indicator that shows
whether it is communicating with PC (I actually don't know exactly
what this means - whether the fact that bluetooth connection was
established or that it is sending data or something else). What
happens when the device is started after WATCH is sent is that it
indicates that it is disconnected. However when you send WATCH again,
it starts indicating connected and starts sending data.

Aren't you doing something special related to the device when WATCH is
sent? It looks like WATCH performs some connection or device
initialization and only when this happens, it starts sending data. If
you do something like that, you should do it also in the case when
some watching clients are connected and a device is detected and added
to the pool - and it seems this doesn't happen right now.
