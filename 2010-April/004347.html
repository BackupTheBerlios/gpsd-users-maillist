<PRE>Hi,

I have a Holux M-1000c GPS logger (MTK-3301 based, connected using
bluetooth) and I'm experiencing 100pct CPU usage after I stop using
the device and switch it off. This is how it can be reproduced:

1. Turn on the GPS device and start xgps
2. Wait until you start receiving some data from the GPS device
3. Keep xgps running and turn off the GPS device
4. Wait for about 20 seconds - after this time gpsd starts consuming 100cpu

I can reproduce this both with gpsd 2.92 that comes with Ubuntu Lucid
beta and also the current git tip, but there wasn't this issue with
2.39.

I had a brief look at the gpsd sources and put some traces into gpsd.c
- what happens here is that the select() at line 1416 stops blocking
and doesn't wait for 1 second as before. From my experience this
happens e.g. when the file descriptor inside the readfds set becomes
invalid - select() then signals this file descriptor as ready to be
read. So I assume that you close the file descriptor but forget to
remove it from the readfds set of select - but I can be totally wrong
here, just a wild guess. The code is a little messy so I didn't
explore any further.

Please let me know if you need some more info or need some traces.

Jiri
