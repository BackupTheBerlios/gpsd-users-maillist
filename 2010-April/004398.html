OK, what I mean is:

0. GPS device is off
1. connect the gpsd socket
2. initialize gpsd with

?WATCH={&quot;enable&quot;:true,&quot;json&quot;:true,&quot;nmea&quot;:false,&quot;raw&quot;:0,&quot;scaled&quot;:false}\n

3. turn on the GPS device

=&gt; I get no data from the GPS device - it seems it's not detected by
gpsd. (I would expect I should get the DEVICE message followed by the
data from the device)

The only way to get gpsd working is to do the above in the order: 3,
1, 2. So basically I never see DEVICE message, only DEVICES as from
what you've told me the device is already in the pool when I connect
gpsd. It appears as if gpsd checked whether there is a gps device only
when the client connects it, otherwise the client doesn't get data
from the device.

Can anyone else reproduce this problem (or does it work for anyone)?
Do I do anything wrong here? Maybe there is something wrong with my
gps device, but it would be interesting to know whether it's a device
problem or gpsd bug.
