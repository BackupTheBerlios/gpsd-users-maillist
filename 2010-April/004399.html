<PRE>Hello Eric,

</I>
Ah, no tutorial - it's actually very simple. Just go to
www.gitorious.org and create an account and a gpsd project there. For
you it will behave like one more git repository. Every time you push,
you should push there as well (you can prepare a hook that does this
for you). The great thing is that everybody can create his own branch
of your mainline, implement his changes and then request merge with
mainline. Then you can merge (or rebase) his changes with mainline.
The contributor can use his branch as a normal repository - there are
no restrictions of any kind for him. Creating the branch is one mouse
click. After he is done, it's again one mouse click for him to request
merge with mainline. One mouse click to delete the repository. For the
maintainer it is definitely easier to merge using git and not merging
patches the contributor has sent if there is some development on the
mainline in between. Also after merging, you'll see all the
contributor's commits in git repository which you lose if you apply
the patch and commit it by yourself. Just have a look at some project
there - in my opinion it's a very nice platform for developer
collaboration. There are actually several portals offering very
similar services, e.g. github to name one.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> several reasons why I think that every serious application should
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> avoid using gps.py:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 2. The interface is pull-based - that is the application is expected
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to periodically pull data from gpsd - but in fact, every GUI
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> application just wants to register a callback and be notified when the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> data is ready. Depending on the application this can be a callback in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a separate thread (yes, I know you don't like them) or by integrating
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it into the main loop of the GUI application. You do this in xgps by
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> listening on the socket, but this is quite hacky - the interface
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> should abstract the user from internals completely - it shouldn't be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> visible that there are some sockets behind it. Also, as I said in (1),
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I haven't seen any documentation of this interface so it's not clear
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> whether the &quot;sock&quot; member is supposed to be public or private.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It's supposed to be private. &#160;But otherwise I don't completely
</I>&gt;<i> understand this criticism.
</I>
OK, my point was that if sock is supposed to be private, you shouldn't
do anything like this in the user application (that is, accessing the
private member from outside the wrapper):

gobject.io_add_watch(daemon.sock, gobject.IO_IN, self.handle_response)
gobject.io_add_watch(daemon.sock, gobject.IO_ERR, self.handle_hangup)
gobject.io_add_watch(daemon.sock, gobject.IO_HUP, self.handle_hangup)

(taken from xgps) And I'm afraid this is the only way you can create a
callback-based interface now. If sock is private, the applications
shouldn't have to rely on its existence - being private means that it
can change any time in the future and break the existing applications
if they rely on its existence.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I disagree with speaking the wire protocol directly, because it leaves
</I>&gt;<i> applications too exposed if that has to change. &#160;But I agree that the
</I>&gt;<i> best design for Python would be (unlike the C interface) a very thin layer
</I>&gt;<i> over the wire protocol. Perhaps one just thick enough to do compatibility
</I>&gt;<i> translations, supposing that ever becomes necessary.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
How much is the protocol going to change in the future? I hope it
won't be too much - I expected you'll just be adding more JSON objects
and possibly add more members of existing objects, but the rest of the
protocol (e.g. the fact that messages end with newline, that every
object contains class member, ...) will remain unchanged. Actually
every application will have to check the result it gets in the
callback anyway as most of the object members may be missing in the
response.

&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;And doing this is quite trivial -
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it's 150 lines for my wrapping interface. Let me know if you are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> interested in seeing it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I would like to see yours. I think I will prototype a new client binding,
</I>&gt;<i> and ask you to critique it.
</I>
Here you are:

<A HREF="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/2554438/gpsgtk.py">http://dl.dropbox.com/u/2554438/gpsgtk.py</A>

Well, it's quite simple, most of the code are various error checks. It
works for gtk applications only as it integrates into the main loop
using gobject.io_add_watch (the same way you do in xgps, I actually
copied how it works). I use callbacks, but maybe it's more gtk-ish to
use signals for notifying the application. But for qt you'd need
something else and the callback-based interface would be different for
pure X, curses, console application, multithreaded application ... So
this is why I think it is better to say &quot;look, user, this is what we
do for gtk, just modify it and use it the way you need&quot;.
