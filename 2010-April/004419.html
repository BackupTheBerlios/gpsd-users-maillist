&gt;<i> OK, what I mean is:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 0. GPS device is off
</I>&gt;<i> 1. connect the gpsd socket
</I>
I still do not understand what you mean by &quot;connect the GPSD socket&quot;.
It would help a lot if you explained this.

&gt;<i> 2. initialize gpsd with
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ?WATCH={&quot;enable&quot;:true,&quot;json&quot;:true,&quot;nmea&quot;:false,&quot;raw&quot;:0,&quot;scaled&quot;:false}\n
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 3. turn on the GPS device
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> =&gt; I get no data from the GPS device - it seems it's not detected by
</I>&gt;<i> gpsd. (I would expect I should get the DEVICE message followed by the
</I>&gt;<i> data from the device)
</I>
You need to turn the GPS on before issuing the WATCH.  Otherwise you'll
have a race condition; the WATCH will attempt to activate (open) the
GPS, and if the open fails it will be removed from the device pool.

&gt;<i> The only way to get gpsd working is to do the above in the order: 3,
</I>&gt;<i> 1, 2. So basically I never see DEVICE message, only DEVICES as from
</I>&gt;<i> what you've told me the device is already in the pool when I connect
</I>&gt;<i> gpsd. It appears as if gpsd checked whether there is a gps device only
</I>&gt;<i> when the client connects it, otherwise the client doesn't get data
</I>&gt;<i> from the device.
</I>
That is correct.

&gt;<i> Can anyone else reproduce this problem (or does it work for anyone)?
</I>&gt;<i> Do I do anything wrong here? Maybe there is something wrong with my
</I>&gt;<i> gps device, but it would be interesting to know whether it's a device
</I>&gt;<i> problem or gpsd bug.
</I>
It's not a bug.  GPSD is working as designed.  

The way it's intended to work with a wired device is like this:

1. You plug a GPS into a USB port. 

2. The hotplug system notices that the device that just went active might
be a GPS, and sends gpsd a message to that effect.

3. gpsd adds the device to its pool, but does not yet open it.

4. Later, a client app issues a WATCH.  At this time, gpsd tries
to activate all the devices in its pool.

5. Any devices it cannot sync up with are thrown out of the pool.

Normally, you should expect a DEVICE message only at step 4, after WATCH
is issued and the device successfully opened.
