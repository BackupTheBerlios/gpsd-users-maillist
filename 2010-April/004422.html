</I>&gt;&gt;<i> OK, what I mean is:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 0. GPS device is off
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 1. connect the gpsd socket
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I still do not understand what you mean by &quot;connect the GPSD socket&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> It would help a lot if you explained this.
</I>
Hmm, I'm not quite sure what's so hard to understand about this - if
you look at the interface sample I gave, I mean these two lines:

self.sock = socket.socket(af, socktype, proto)
self.sock.connect(sa)  # &lt;-- TALKING ABOUT THIS CONNECT - NORMAL
TCP/IP CONNECTION :-)

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 2. initialize gpsd with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ?WATCH={&quot;enable&quot;:true,&quot;json&quot;:true,&quot;nmea&quot;:false,&quot;raw&quot;:0,&quot;scaled&quot;:false}\n
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>
cmd = '?WATCH={&quot;enable&quot;:true,\
               &quot;json&quot;:true,\
               &quot;nmea&quot;:false,\
               &quot;raw&quot;:0,\
               &quot;scaled&quot;:false}\n'

success = self.sock.send(cmd) == len(cmd)

&gt;&gt;<i> 3. turn on the GPS device
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> =&gt; I get no data from the GPS device - it seems it's not detected by
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> gpsd. (I would expect I should get the DEVICE message followed by the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> data from the device)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You need to turn the GPS on before issuing the WATCH. &#160;Otherwise you'll
</I>&gt;<i> have a race condition; the WATCH will attempt to activate (open) the
</I>&gt;<i> GPS, and if the open fails it will be removed from the device pool.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The only way to get gpsd working is to do the above in the order: 3,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 1, 2. So basically I never see DEVICE message, only DEVICES as from
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> what you've told me the device is already in the pool when I connect
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> gpsd. It appears as if gpsd checked whether there is a gps device only
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> when the client connects it, otherwise the client doesn't get data
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> from the device.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That is correct.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Can anyone else reproduce this problem (or does it work for anyone)?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Do I do anything wrong here? Maybe there is something wrong with my
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> gps device, but it would be interesting to know whether it's a device
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> problem or gpsd bug.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It's not a bug. &#160;GPSD is working as designed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The way it's intended to work with a wired device is like this:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. You plug a GPS into a USB port.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2. The hotplug system notices that the device that just went active might
</I>&gt;<i> be a GPS, and sends gpsd a message to that effect.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3. gpsd adds the device to its pool, but does not yet open it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 4. Later, a client app issues a WATCH. &#160;At this time, gpsd tries
</I>&gt;<i> to activate all the devices in its pool.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 5. Any devices it cannot sync up with are thrown out of the pool.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Normally, you should expect a DEVICE message only at step 4, after WATCH
</I>&gt;<i> is issued and the device successfully opened.
</I>&gt;<i> --
</I>&gt;<i>                &lt;a href=&quot;<A HREF="http://www.catb.org/~esr/">http://www.catb.org/~esr/</A>&quot;&gt;Eric S. Raymond&lt;/a&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
And why couldn't it be in the order 4, 1, 2? What I would like to see is:

1. gpsd daemon is running, client application is started, connects
(hope it's clear now) gpsd, issues WATCH.
2. like your 2 above
3. gpsd checks if some clients are watching. If not, it only adds the
device into its pool. If someone is watching (and if he isn't watching
a different device), start sending him data from the device.

Or I'll try to tell it from the perspective of a user of say GPS
navigation application:

1. User starts the application (which internally does the same as in
step 1 above)
2. He starts his GPS device - his position will start updating
3. An interference comes so the bluetooth connection gets lost - his
position isn't updated any more
4. The bluetooth connection gets reestablished after a while - the
position starts updating again
5. The user turns off his bluetooth GPS device - his position isn't
updated any more
6. The user connects his USB GPS device -  the position starts updating again

&gt;<i>From your description, this isn't possible now - you have to reissue
</I>WATCH after 2, 4 and 6 in order to get updates again (and looks like
some remains of the pull interface where you have to issue a command
first in order to get some data). From the application user
perspective, currently there has to be a button &quot;reinitialize&quot; that
reissues WATCH - what I would like is that no such button is necessary
in the user interface.

Is there some technical problem implementing this behaviour? From what
you say it seems that gpsd gets informed when the device gets
available so I don't see a reason why, when some clients are still
connected and watching, the clients couldn't start receiving data from
the device (after first receiving the DEVICE message). This is
actually what I expected would happen even from the documentation.
