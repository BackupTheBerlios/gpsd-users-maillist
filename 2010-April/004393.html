&gt;<i> I think that the tty freq identification is working better if the gps has
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;fixed&quot;, I did the above experiments indoor, without &quot;fix&quot;.
</I>
Oh, that's *bad*.  

It suggests that you have one of the rare, hideosly broken chipsets
like the Furuno GN-77 that don't ship validly checksummed packets
until they have fix.  Wuthout the checksum, our packet sniffer can't
know it has locked onto a packet type.

What was your make and model again?  
 
&gt;<i> So, i know that there are no flags to set freq, is there a run time config
</I>&gt;<i> file? i know that it is almost as having a bunch of flags, but it seems to
</I>&gt;<i> be needed, after all.
</I>
No such file, and there isn't going to be - ever - for reasons I explain in
the Hacking Guide. Any gain in supporting one or two broken device types
that way would be more than offset by additional code complexity and
test paths.  Just not worth it.

Your only way out would be to compile GPSD for a fixed port speed. 
I put this option in for the SBC crowd, but it's also a blunt instrument
for coping with devices so brain-dead that autobauding on them fails.

Unfortunately, even then you may lose. As I said, without valid checksums
on the packets, the sniffer won't lock to the NMEA packet type and
know how to parse what it's seeing.
