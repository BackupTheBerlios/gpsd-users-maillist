<PRE>When Jon Schlueter told me he had a TNT Revolution he could give me
access to at nog.yazug.com, it made me happy. The fact that we used to
have TNT support and it broke has been bothering me for a long time.

I logged on to nog.yazug.com did the small amount of work needed to
verify that I could see a stream of PTNTHTM sentences on /dev/ttyS0.
Ran gpsd, hit my first problem: There's also a GPS-18 attached to the
host.  The USB Garmin probe finds it in /proc/bus/usb/devices, doesn't
check that the device matches the one we're probing, and we get a
false lock.

(Gary: We *must* fix this.  It's not acceptable that USB Garmins elbow
aside other devices like that. See also the Berlios tracker bug at
&lt;<A HREF="http://developer.berlios.de/bugs/?func=detailbug&amp;bug_id=16955&amp;group_id=2116">http://developer.berlios.de/bugs/?func=detailbug&amp;bug_id=16955&amp;group_id=2116</A>&gt;.)

Once I reconfigured with --disable-garmin and --enable-tnt fixed a
couple of minor compilation issues with stale code, gpsd was able to
get sync lock at 19200bps and I saw PTNTHTM coming through gpsd. Win!
I was happily preparing to design a JSON compass-data report when
I ran headlong into a *serious* problem.

We've run out of validity-mask bits.

Various layers of GPSD, including the client library, return data 
by updating pieces of a blackboard structure, struct gpsdata_t.
Because not all of these are updated at the same time, the fix.set
member is a bit-mask flagging which pieces of data are currently valid.

This gets really significant for the rarely-used pieces of the structure that 
live in a union near the end of it.

    /* pack things never reported together to reduce structure size */ 
#define UNION_SET	(RTCM2_SET|RTCM3_SET|AIS_SET|VERSION_SET|DEVICELIST_SET|ERROR_SET)
    union {
	/* unusual forms of sensor data that might come up the pipe */ 
	struct rtcm2_t	rtcm2;
	struct rtcm3_t	rtcm3;
	struct ais_t ais;
	struct compass_t compass;
	struct rawdata_t raw;
	/* &quot;artificial&quot; structures for various protocol responses */
	struct version_t version;
	struct {
	    double time;
	    int ndevices;
	    struct devconfig_t list[MAXDEVICES_PER_USER];
	} devices;
	char error[80];
    };

Note that the union is anonyous. This technically breaks compatibility
with pre-C99 C, but I did it so that under most circumstances app devs
could simply ignore what's in the union and what isn't.

See the compass_t union member in there? That's where the data from a
TNT is supposed to go.  Now, if you're an especially astute reader,
you'll have noticed there's no COMPASS_SET in the UNION_SET
definition, and thus no flag to indicate that we should interpret the
union as a compass_t structure.  Here's the entire set of mask bits
presently defined:

#define ONLINE_SET	0x00000001u
#define TIME_SET	0x00000002u
#define TIMERR_SET	0x00000004u
#define LATLON_SET	0x00000008u
#define ALTITUDE_SET	0x00000010u
#define SPEED_SET	0x00000020u
#define TRACK_SET	0x00000040u
#define CLIMB_SET	0x00000080u
#define STATUS_SET	0x00000100u
#define MODE_SET	0x00000200u
#define DOP_SET  	0x00000400u
#define VERSION_SET	0x00000800u	/* only used in client library */
#define HERR_SET	0x00001000u
#define VERR_SET	0x00002000u
#define PERR_SET	0x00004000u
#define POLICY_SET	0x00008000u	/* only used in client library */
#define SATELLITE_SET	0x00010000u
#define RAW_SET		0x00020000u
#define USED_SET	0x00040000u
#define SPEEDERR_SET	0x00080000u
#define TRACKERR_SET	0x00100000u
#define CLIMBERR_SET	0x00200000u
#define DEVICE_SET	0x00400000u
#define DEVICELIST_SET	0x00800000u
#define DEVICEID_SET	0x01000000u
#define ERROR_SET	0x02000000u
#define RTCM2_SET	0x04000000u
#define RTCM3_SET	0x08000000u
#define AIS_SET 	0x10000000u
#define PACKET_SET	0x20000000u
#define CLEAR_SET	0x40000000u	/* sentence starts a reporting cycle */
#define REPORT_SET	0x80000000u	/* sentence ends a reporting cycle */

The key point here is that there are 32 of them. And COMPASS_SET isn't
there.  There's no way out of this that isn't ugly.  Here are the
alternatives I've been able to come up with, compkere with handy
labels for later discussion:

1. (GO64) Start using higher-order bits on the assumption that our int is
64 bits. Preserve the existing design and binary compatibilty on
64-bit machines. Breaks 32-bit machines.

2. (NAIVE_SPLIT) Break this mask in two - probably one for the basic
data (TPV, SKY) and a second for union parts. There are other ways it
could be split; the point is, any obvious way of doing this will break
both binary and source compatibility (but for an unobvious way, see
AUXDATA below). And now app developers have a two-step check
to see if any particulatr piece of union data is present.

3. (STEAL_RTCM3) Steal the bit used by RTCM3_SET, because support for
that is very incomplete and it is highly unlikely anyone is using
it. Disadvantages: (1) we'd have to drop RTCM3 support, (2) I could be
wrong about it not being in use, (3) this would be an ugly hack, and
(4) it only postpones the crisis - what happens when we have to add
the *next* bit?

4. (STEAL_RAW) Steal the RAW_SET bit, because we haven't implemented
raw-data reporting yet. See objections (1)-(4) above, s/RTCM3/RAW/.

5. (STEAL_UNUSED) Use the fact that CLEAR_SET and REPORT_SET aren't in
use in the client library and steal one of those.  Requires intrusive
changes to all the drivers and the daemon core (those status bits have
to live somewhere) but at least confines the ugliness to where app
developers can't see it. Problem: Now we're just one new capability
away from having the same problem all over again.

6. (BLOB) Suggestion by sanooj on IRC: Abandon having a gps_data_t
that the app developers can see inside.  Instead, make struct
gpsdata_t an opaque blob that can be copied but only unpacked by
function accessors.  Requires at least one break in binary and source
compatibility, but solves the problem forever. Or, at least, until a
dev in a hurry peeks.

7. (AUXDATA) Variant of approach 2 (builds on another suggestion by
sanooj). In this one, we steal RAW_SET's 0x00020000u to indicate that
there is extension data in a new struct that lives in the union.  The
struct begins with a bitmask and has yet another union is the only
other member.  Something like this:

#define AUXDATA_SET	0x00020000u

    /* pack things never reported together to reduce structure size */ 
#define UNION_SET	(RTCM2_SET|RTCM3_SET|AIS_SET|VERSION_SET|DEVICELIST_SET|ERROR_SET|AUXDATA_SET)
    union {
	/* unusual forms of sensor data that might come up the pipe */ 
	struct rtcm2_t	rtcm2;
	struct rtcm3_t	rtcm3;
	struct ais_t ais;
	/* &quot;artificial&quot; structures for various protocol responses */
	struct version_t version;
	struct {
	    double time;
	    int ndevices;
	    struct devconfig_t list[MAXDEVICES_PER_USER];
	} devices;
	char error[80];
        struct auxdata_t {
	    enum {compass_aux, raw_aux} auxtype;
	    union {
	        struct compass_t compass;
	        struct rawdata_t raw;
	    }
	};
    };

Doesn't break binary compatibility, but it's ugly as hell.  App devs
have a two-step procedure to check for validity of some data.
Mistakes would be distressingly easy.

8. (CLEANSHEET) This is where I say &quot;screw it&quot; and design a new client
API with different names for the blackboard structure and entry points,
leaving the old one in place but less capable.

The reason this would get us out of trouble is that most of the
existing _SET flags are actually relics of the old protocol.  A new
design could get away with these:

#define VERSION_VALID	0x00000001u
#define WATCH_VALID	0x00000002u
#define TPV_VALID	0x00000004u
#define SKY_VALID	0x00000008u
#define DEVICE_VALID	0x00000010u
#define RTCM2_VALID	0x00000020u
#define RTCM3_VALID	0x00000040u
#define AIS_VALID 	0x00000080u
#define RAW_VALID	0x00000100u
#define COMPASS_VALID	0x00000200u
#define ERROR_VALID	0x00000400u

leaving 21 bits for expansion.  For other reasons this might be a good
idea, see <A HREF="http://gpsd.berlios.de/future.html">http://gpsd.berlios.de/future.html</A>

[President Clinton] boasts about 186,000 people denied firearms under
the Brady Law rules.  The Brady Law has been in force for three years.  In
that time, they have prosecuted seven people and put three of them in
prison.  You know, the President has entertained more felons than that at
fundraising coffees in the White House, for Pete's sake.&quot;
