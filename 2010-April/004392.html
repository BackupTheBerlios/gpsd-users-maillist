<PRE>Ji&#345;&#237; Techet &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-users">techet at gmail.com</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> (by the way, you might want to consider using gitorious - it's a very
</I>&gt;<i> convenient way for sending and merging patches from external
</I>&gt;<i> developers)
</I>
Point me to a tutorial?
 
&gt;<i> There are several bugs combined in gps.py:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1. In
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>                 if &quot;driver&quot; in data:
</I>&gt;<i>                     self.driver = self.data[&quot;driver&quot;]
</I>&gt;<i>                 if &quot;subtype&quot; in data:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> you are testing data, but it should be self.data.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 2. The dictwrapper class must contain __contains__() method - without
</I>&gt;<i> this you can't use &quot;in&quot; for testing element presence.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 3. You should set the data structures also when you get DEVICES class
</I>&gt;<i> response for the reason mentioned above.
</I>
I took your patches, and I did test them.  They're good, and will ship 
in 2.93.
 
&gt;<i> Note that I haven't tested the above patch much - for my application I
</I>&gt;<i> have decided to reimplement the python interface by myself - thanks to
</I>&gt;<i> the new protocol (really good work!) it was quite trivial.
</I>
Yes, it would be.  The wire-protocol objects map to Python objects
in a very natural way.

&gt;<i>                                                          There are
</I>&gt;<i> several reasons why I think that every serious application should
</I>&gt;<i> avoid using gps.py:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1. There is no formal documentation of the interface - one cannot be
</I>&gt;<i> sure which methods and mainly data members are public and which are
</I>&gt;<i> private. I just felt uncomfortable that something will change in the
</I>&gt;<i> future that will break my application.
</I>
My original plan was to leave them as is.  But you have a good point.
The interface, as it is, is an ugly amphibian - caught between
backward compatibility with the old protocol (all those data members)
and the new, under which it is more natural to simply return a report
object corresponding to the last JSON object to come up the wire.

It would probably be better if I just built a new, simpler interface
class and discarded the retained-data members and all the other old
cruft.
 
&gt;<i> 2. The interface is pull-based - that is the application is expected
</I>&gt;<i> to periodically pull data from gpsd - but in fact, every GUI
</I>&gt;<i> application just wants to register a callback and be notified when the
</I>&gt;<i> data is ready. Depending on the application this can be a callback in
</I>&gt;<i> a separate thread (yes, I know you don't like them) or by integrating
</I>&gt;<i> it into the main loop of the GUI application. You do this in xgps by
</I>&gt;<i> listening on the socket, but this is quite hacky - the interface
</I>&gt;<i> should abstract the user from internals completely - it shouldn't be
</I>&gt;<i> visible that there are some sockets behind it. Also, as I said in (1),
</I>&gt;<i> I haven't seen any documentation of this interface so it's not clear
</I>&gt;<i> whether the &quot;sock&quot; member is supposed to be public or private.
</I>
It's supposed to be private.  But otherwise I don't completely 
understand this criticism.  

I actually agree about callback-centered interfaces - you'll note
that I wrote one in xgps.  But something has to actually manage the
file descriptor for polling and handle the case where a JSON object
arrives fragmented across more than one read, and it might well be
an interface class.

&gt;<i> 3. The interface isn't pythonic - poll() returns values like 0, -1,
</I>&gt;<i> which isn't very nice.
</I>
Agreed.  It was originally written to mimic the C interface.
That was a defensible decision under the old protocol, but it's
awakward and ugly under the new one. Hence the iterator interface.

&gt;<i> 4. The interface contains a lot of garbage used for backward
</I>&gt;<i> compatibility - quite understood, but this can also introduce some
</I>&gt;<i> bugs, which are more probable with dynamically typed languages.
</I>
I also agree about the historical junk; it ought to be chucked.  I think
what I anm likely to end up doing is writing a ndw gps.client class
adapted for the JSON protocol and documenting it.

&gt;<i> I'm not saying this to criticize but to suggest that python clients
</I>&gt;<i> should be encouraged to use the gpsd protocol directly. Each of them
</I>&gt;<i> can have some specific needs for the callback mechanisms, which cannot
</I>&gt;<i> be addressed by a single interface.
</I>
I disagree with speaking the wire protocol directly, because it leaves
applications too exposed if that has to change.  But I agree that the
best design for Python would be (unlike the C interface) a very thin layer
over the wire protocol. Perhaps one just thick enough to do compatibility
translations, supposing that ever becomes necessary.

&gt;<i>                                  And doing this is quite trivial -
</I>&gt;<i> it's 150 lines for my wrapping interface. Let me know if you are
</I>&gt;<i> interested in seeing it.
</I>
I would like to see yours. I think I will prototype a new client binding,
and ask you to critique it.
