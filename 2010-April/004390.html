<PRE>Ji&#345;&#237; Techet &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-users">techet at gmail.com</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> The only problem I see now is that with the bluetooth device I don't
</I>&gt;<i> get any data from the device when
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1. I first connect gpsd (the gps device is off)
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Turn on the gps device
</I>
What do you mean by &quot;connect gpsd&quot;? 

If you just mean &quot;Pass the device name to gpsd as a command-line
argument&quot; or even &quot;pass its name to the control socket as an available
device&quot; (as the hotplug script does) then that should work fine.

All either of these operations do is put the device in gpsd's internal
pool of potential data sources; it won't be opened until some client
declares a watch.  As long as no client requests data 
until after you power on the Bluetooth device, there sgould be no
problem.
 
&gt;<i> Is this problem related to the FAQ question
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Why do I have to restart gpsd whenever I power-cycle my Bluetooth device?&quot;
</I>
I don't know. I'm afraid I don't even know if the bug I described in the
Bluetooth bug is still there. It was reported by a user some time back.
 
&gt;<i> (I don't really need to restart gspd to get some data, all I have to
</I>&gt;<i> do is to first turn on the device and then connect gpsd.) I had this
</I>&gt;<i> problem with 2.3x so it's nothing specific to the new protocol. If
</I>&gt;<i> it's OS problem, has it been reported to the kernel developers? If so,
</I>&gt;<i> is there any reason why this hasn't been fixed yet?
</I>
Sorry, my ignorance of Bluetooth is nearly total.  I have no answers
to these questions.
 
We do, however, have Bluetooth users on this list.  One of them might
be able to help you more effectively than I can.

I'll respond to your issues about the Python interface separately.
