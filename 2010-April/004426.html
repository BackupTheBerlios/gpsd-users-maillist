OK, that's what I was trying to pin down.
 
&gt;<i> And why couldn't it be in the order 4, 1, 2? What I would like to see is:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1. gpsd daemon is running, client application is started, connects
</I>&gt;<i> (hope it's clear now) gpsd, issues WATCH.
</I>&gt;<i> 2. like your 2 above
</I>&gt;<i> 3. gpsd checks if some clients are watching. If not, it only adds the
</I>&gt;<i> device into its pool. If someone is watching (and if he isn't watching
</I>&gt;<i> a different device), start sending him data from the device.
</I>
But....that *is* how it works.  Or at least, how I designed it to work,
and how it seems to work when I test it.  I am deeply confused now.
 
&gt;<i> Or I'll try to tell it from the perspective of a user of say GPS
</I>&gt;<i> navigation application:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1. User starts the application (which internally does the same as in
</I>&gt;<i> step 1 above)
</I>&gt;<i> 2. He starts his GPS device - his position will start updating
</I>&gt;<i> 3. An interference comes so the bluetooth connection gets lost - his
</I>&gt;<i> position isn't updated any more
</I>&gt;<i> 4. The bluetooth connection gets reestablished after a while - the
</I>&gt;<i> position starts updating again
</I>&gt;<i> 5. The user turns off his bluetooth GPS device - his position isn't
</I>&gt;<i> updated any more
</I>&gt;<i> 6. The user connects his USB GPS device -  the position starts updating again
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;From your description, this isn't possible now - you have to reissue
</I>&gt;<i> WATCH after 2, 4 and 6 in order to get updates again (and looks like
</I>&gt;<i> some remains of the pull interface where you have to issue a command
</I>&gt;<i> first in order to get some data).
</I>
No.  You only have to issue WATCH once.  The way to think about it is
that whenever one or more WATCHES is active, gpsd wants to have every
device in its pool open.  Whenever the hotplug system tells it one has
gone live, it tries to open the device and stream reports from it to
everybody.

I talked about a race condition before because gpsd will throw a device
out of its pool if a read from it fails.

If all client sessions close, then gpsd revets to putting devices
it's notified about in its pool without trying to open them.

&gt;<i> Is there some technical problem implementing this behaviour? From what
</I>&gt;<i> you say it seems that gpsd gets informed when the device gets
</I>&gt;<i> available so I don't see a reason why, when some clients are still
</I>&gt;<i> connected and watching, the clients couldn't start receiving data from
</I>&gt;<i> the device (after first receiving the DEVICE message). This is
</I>&gt;<i> actually what I expected would happen even from the documentation.
</I>
Yes, that's how it's supposed to work.  If it's not working that
way for you we need to fugure out why.
