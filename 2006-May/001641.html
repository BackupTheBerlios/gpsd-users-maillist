</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>Yeah, that is what I meant. I was thinking one thing and typing 
something else.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So what are you using the TNTC for if you don't use the magnetometer?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>We used it as a device to supply heading information for a vehicle. When 
a gps is moving slow it doesn't provide good heading information which 
is important to determine how to steer a vehicle. Also when the heading 
from the compass and the heading from a gps are opposite you know you 
are rolling backwards. That is also important for going up hills.

&gt;<i> As far as the antenna positioner isn't moving fast, I can use the fluid
</I>&gt;<i> sensor for leveling.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>Yes that is correct.
&gt;<i> But the magnetometer could be affected by the metal environment. There I
</I>&gt;<i> would more prefer a 2 antenna GPS for northing, as I picked up in
</I>&gt;<i> another thread of this list.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>Yes this is a possibility but you need a special GPS unit to do this. 
The gps is not determining the position of it's two antennas but instead 
measuring the phase difference of the signals that it receives from both 
antennas. This is how it can determine heading information more 
precisely. This kind of GPS is going to cost a lot of money.

&gt;<i> gpsd: Which variable did you use for heading? The devel list was
</I>&gt;<i> discussing not to use COG for it but the existing heading value.
</I>&gt;<i> Pitch and Roll wasn't part of the basic NMEA (?) so did you add them?
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for this part of code.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>I didn't add pitch and roll to gpsd because I didn't need it at the time.
&gt;<i> Using the TNTC: For calibrating the magnetometer one has to use the
</I>&gt;<i> MSWindows Software. Is that only necessary once?
</I>&gt;<i> I thought about doing a differential angle measurement at azimuth 0 and
</I>&gt;<i> 180 degree with (a-b)/2 without calibration. Then only gpsd would be
</I>&gt;<i> needed.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>It is only necessary to re-calibrate if the environment around the 
compass changes because metal was introduced or removed. If it is 
mounted away from metal and electrical current then it isn't necessary 
to recalibrate ever. The user manual that comes from True North is top 
notch and very detailed. There is so much that goes into making these 
compasses work accurately and reliably and the guys at True North 
definitely know what they are doing. The TNT device considers hard iron, 
software iron and static fields when it is calibrated. To much to 
discuss here but it is complex to say the least. With the TN compass we 
had 0.1 degree accuracy for heading which is far better than a gps could 
provide.

A cheaper alternative might be a development kit I found at Silicon 
Labs:  
<A HREF="http://www.silabs.com/tgwWebApp/public/web_content/products/Microcontrollers/en/F350-COMPASS-RD.htm">http://www.silabs.com/tgwWebApp/public/web_content/products/Microcontrollers/en/F350-COMPASS-RD.htm</A>

If it is still available it might be worth checking out. This is a lot 
less expensive than the True North device and has an LCD screen. I doubt 
it has as sophisticated calibration but I don't know what you are 
looking for.

Curt
