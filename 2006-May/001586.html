<PRE>Hi Eric,
Thanks for the reply.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>Hi All,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>I am running a pre-release version of familiar 0.8.4 (rc1) on an
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>iPaq h2200 interfacing to a Holux GPSlim236 BT GPS via gpsd2.20.  I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>connect using the rfcomm layer and primarily use roadmap as an
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>application (full details here:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i><A HREF="http://www.handhelds.org/moin/moin.cgi/HpIpaqH2200gps">http://www.handhelds.org/moin/moin.cgi/HpIpaqH2200gps</A>) I have had to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>implement a somewhat heavy-handed fix for suspend/resume and I just
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>wanted to see if this is a reasonable approach or if anyone has a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>better idea of where to deal with the issue.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I'm not certain, but I think your &quot;heavy-handed&quot; fix may be the best
</I>&gt;<i>spproach.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>Fundamentally gpsd works great - I start up the app, it makes a call
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>to gpsd, gpsd binds to /dev/rfcomm0 and rfcomm handles the BT
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>connection to the GPS (at least, this is my layman's understanding of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>it)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>That sounds right.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>not sure if this is really that important, but the BT/rfcomm method on 
the gpsd.berlios.de site is not the best way to do it, as it is manual 
every time you connect - the method I describe in the link above allows 
for automatic connection, which I believe to be the whole point of 
rfcomm.  Is it possible to get the site updated? (I could draft the 
changes in your existing template if that would help)

&gt;&gt;<i>The problem arises when I suspend the ipaq (for example when I stop
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>for groceries) - when I resume the ipaq, the program hangs with a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>GPSD,R=1 and does not update position.  It is quite easy to fix: I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>can either restart the program (which then makes a request of gpsd
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>and....) or I can restart gpsd, and it reports out position fine.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Got it...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>I have added a script to the suspend/resume apmd scripts to kill
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>gpsd on suspend and start it on resume.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>Is there a better way to do this?  Is this fixed in a newer version?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>I think it is most likely related to the first FAQ cited below.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>It seems to me to be more likely related to the second one (e.g. the
</I>&gt;<i>Bluetooth-stack problem).  By hypothesis, your gpsd has already bound
</I>&gt;<i>a device when you suspend it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>You might want to try having just one script that SIGHUPs gpsd on
</I>&gt;<i>resume.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>that's not a bad idea, as I don't really think it matters whether gpsd 
is shut down before suspend - in fact, it probably makes suspend a bit 
slower (and it is slow enough as is on familiar linux....)

&gt;<i>Either way, I'd take a patch that added that script to the distribution.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I would happily supply you with the script I used, but it isn't very 
involved - If you are asking for a code patch to the gpsd source though, 
then it will be quite some time before I can supply that, as I really 
don't have a development environment set up, nor am I a C programmer, 
nor am I familiar with the gpsd code base  :P  however, if you want to 
go that route I can give it a go, but it won't be an immediate 
turnaround. (I do have some experience with programming, but it is more 
with scripting languages... perl, php, etc... it's only syntax, so I am 
sure that I could learn C)

&gt;<i>Are you using an RPM-based distro?
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I use familiar linux with gpsd - an ipkg-based distro compatible with 
deb binaries - on an ipaq (arm) that is really not good for compiling or 
building anything as it is a handheld :)

I also have a gentoo based system that I am constantly struggling with - 
I've used debian poorly for 5 years and I find some of the gentoo stuff 
maddening, but I haven't given up and rebuilt it yet.

Why the question on the distribution?

Thanks,
josh
